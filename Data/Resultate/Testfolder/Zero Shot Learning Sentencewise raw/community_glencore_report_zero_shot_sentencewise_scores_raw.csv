traditional food and medicine plants of the Gurdanji people to ensure MRM has sufficient information to manage landscape vegetation communities in a way that incorporates their ecological heritage.', 'Walking through the bush on the mine site, the Gurdanji people identify plants of value and explain their cultural, medicinal and nutritional purposes.', 'There is also an ongoing study into fish catching and eating habits of local Indigenous people.', 'In the study, IndoPacific Environmental is consulting with local people to gain an understanding of the fish species caught and eaten as well as documenting the names for each fish in the four local Indigenous languages.', 'Community treeplanting programme MRM has an extensive nursery to support the rehabilitation of the McArthur River

off area accommodates the extra plants and allows the plants to acclimatise to the harsh natural environment prior to planting.', 'For a number of years, MRM has hired local people on seasonal treeplanting crews.', 'In , MRMs environment team employed two local indigenous trainees in dedicated rehabilitation roles.', 'Traditional Owners also wanted to become more involved in MRMs environmental programmes and MRM invited community members to assist in tree propagation and planting on site.', 'A number of Traditional Owners spent time working alongside the environment team collecting and propagating seeds and planting out tubestock.', 'School training partnership During , local students attended a site visit and information session at MRMs nursery, where they learned about nursery management and the various rehabilitation techniques used on site.', 'MRM hopes that this will encourage an interest in environmental management in preparation for the start of a certificate course in Conservation and Land Management.', 'Glencore Sustainability Report Best practice water management passes test The implementation of bestpractice water management at Australias McArthur River Mine MRM was put to the test during a nearrecord rainfall event during the wet season.', 'The greater than in year rainfall event saw mm fall in just seven days, with almost mm in one

Metals Ltd BRM owns the last untouched piece of marshland adjacent to the River Thames, the Botany Marshes.', 'BRM is actively managing the marshland to ensure its longterm sustainability.', 'During to , BRM sponsored a number of field surveys, ecological studies, impact assessments and habitat management plans that confirmed the presence of legally protected redlisted and endangered species.', 'The studies showed that the following were using the Botany Mashes as ‘home: otters, yellowfaced bee, saltmarsh shortspur beetle, viviparous lizard, harvest mouse and the Cetti warbler.', 'The analysis showed that the deterioration was avoidable through active intervention to prevent the marsh from drying out and scrub taking over.', 'BRM developed a project to divert rainwater from its main road into a new pond, which would then naturally feed into a ditch system to maintain the wetness of the marsh.', 'This included digging, creating pathways and clearing the ditches.', 'Today, the diversion of clean offsite water, which previously flowed through BRMs land, has also improved BRMs management of its onsite water during heavy rain events.', 'In early , the local community began to access the Botany Marshes for recreational activities.', 'During , BRM is implementing phase two, which involves establishing a newly developed Habitat Management Plan, created by Kent Wildlife Trust.', 'The Plan includes managing the growth of the reed beds and grassland to encourage greater vegetation diversity.', 'BRM will continue to work with the Kent Wildlife Trust to ensure the sustainability of local biodiversity.', 'Since , volunteers from Kent Wildlife Trust have hosted a number of education days for local school children.', 'Without active intervention the marshland would have deteriorated to a point where it was unable to support the protected species.', 'In early , a bird survey was carried out that recorded extra species compared to the baseline ecology

that are considered to be important for the conservation of wildlife.', 'During the wet season, from around November to April, water is collected and managed, and water is then evaporated during the dry season.', 'With a big wet season experienced the previous year, the mine site took extra precautions heading into the season to ensure it was ready.', 'These included: • Upgrades to water management infrastructure and rigorous maintenance • Treatment of open pit and underground water to provide additional wet season storage capacity • Maintenance of river gauging stations and early warning flood systems • The renegotiation of an approved waste water discharge licence to give more flexibility for the release of water As the severe rain hit the local area, the good planning delivered results, there was no uncontrolled discharge of water from the mine site, and downstream areas were protected.', 'One of the keys to achieving this result was the establishment of onsite capacity to analyse water samples with a certified laboratory.', 'This meant the mine could quickly understand the quality of water from different sources and deal with it accordingly.', 'The safety and security of the mines workers was the first priority.', 'During the extreme rainfall, a helicopter was on standby on site for emergency response to ensure the safety of the site personnel.',
