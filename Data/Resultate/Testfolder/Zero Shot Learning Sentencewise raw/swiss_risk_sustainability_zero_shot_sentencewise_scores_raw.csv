to businesses for decisive action.', 'Building on our successful track record, our Group Executive Committee has thus decided to further strengthen our efforts and to develop an enhanced Group Sustainability Strategy.', 'This enhanced strategy defines sustainability as a strategic, longterm value driver and embeds this approach throughout our reinsurance value chain.', 'At its core, it involves managing and monitoring risks and opportunities associated with environmental, social and governance ESG issues.', 'Sustainable reinsurance covers both the liability and the asset side of our

offering protection against them.', 'Resilience and sustainability: the link Making the world more resilient is Swiss Res vision.', 'Sustainability as a strategic priority supports our ability to meet this vision.', 'Effective reinsurance protection plays a vital role in strengthening this ability.', 'Sustainability denotes the principle of achieving economic and social development that can be maintained in the long term, ie without overusing precious resources.', 'Major challenges that undermine sustainable development, eg climate change, insecure food supplies, health funding gaps, ageing infrastructure etc.', 'Our focus on sustainability seeks to identify and address the challenges that threaten stable longterm development.', 'From the perspective of a reinsurer this translates into offering protection against such risks where viable, supporting efforts to reduce them and to prevent them “adaptation” and “mitigation”.', 'This in turn helps strengthen resilience.', 'Finally, companies that make sustainability a priority across all aspects of their businesses are better qualified to adjust to the changing risk landscape they become more sustainable themselves.', 'In Swiss Res own case, this enhances our longterm prospects of continuing to meet our vision of making the world more resilient.', 'Swiss Re Sustainability Report Our approach to sustainability Sustainability Ambitions Mitigating climate risk and advancing the energy transition The effects of climate change are already evident and impacting our risk landscape: warmer average temperatures, rising sea levels, longer and more frequent heatwaves, as well as more intense precipitation events.', 'These phenomena are becoming the new normal and will increasingly impact our way of life, our health and our natural environment.', 'Urgent questions we need to ask are how to tackle climate change, how to advance the transition to renewable energy, and how we can best adapt to and mitigate climate risk.', 'Our response Swiss Res main responses to this challenge are to make societies more resilient to the growing risks of climate change and natural hazards, as well as evolving our way of doing business towards netzero carbon emissions by , in line with the Paris Agreement.', 'With our underwriting and innovative reinsurance solutions, we can help communities and businesses get back on their feet quickly after a disaster, as well as prepare them for more frequent and severe climate impacts.', 'We build partnerships with clients and governments to develop scalable solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change.', 'This includes offering solutions that support the transition to more sustainable, lowcarbon energy systems by managing the risks associated with renewable energy projects and making them more attractive to investors with reinsurance backing.', 'Overall, it is our goal to be a leading reinsurance capacity provider for the development of renewable energy solutions.', 'Furthermore, we promote sustainable practices in our own operations to demonstrate good stewardship, lead by example and drive longterm performance.', 'We have adopted a holistic strategy to responsible investing, including investment practices for our assets to consider environmental, social and governance ESG criteria in our investment decisions.', 'Limiting global warming is part of this effort, and we are reinforcing it by further reducing our own carbon footprint across our operations, investments and reinsurance offerings.', 'We are implementing our Group Sustainability Strategy through a structured process and are currently working on bringing it to life by defining targets, metrics and actions for our three Sustainability Ambitions.', 'Adopting a sequential approach, we have first started to develop a Climate Action Plan, which also serves as our climate strategy see below.', 'Our Climate Action Plan Swiss Re first detected the potential longterm challenges posed by climate change some years ago.', 'Consequently, it has become our most important sustainability issue: For a reinsurer, climate change constitutes a key topic because it leads to an increase in the severity and a change in the patterns of natural catastrophes such as windstorms, floods, excessive rainfall, heatwaves and drought.', 'In combination with growing asset concentrations in exposed areas and more widespread insurance protection, this will cause a steady rise in losses.', 'Climate change continues to be an essential element in our enhanced Group Sustainability Strategy: “Mitigating climate risk and advancing the energy transition” is one of our three overarching Sustainability Ambitions.', 'In the process launched to define metrics and setting targets, we have put the initial focus on this topic and started to develop a Climate Action Plan.', 'Building on our commitments and initiatives of recent years, our Climate Action Plan, which also serves as our climate change strategy, combines three objectives: .', 'We aim to become the leading reinsurance company on physical climate risk.', 'For specific targets related to these

Report Building societal resilience Technological and economic development, population growth, ageing populations and other societal trends are increasingly putting people and assets at risk.', 'Swiss Res responsible investment strategy, as well as its work in the areas of health and longevity, agriculture and infrastructure represent some of the ways we help build societal resilience and reduce related vulnerabilities.', 'Our response Today, billions of people are either uninsured or underinsured for life and health risks.', 'But climate change and rising food prices pose a serious threat, not least to farmers and the agricultural industry.', 'To this end, our goal is to ensure health and wellbeing across all age groups, as well as affordable and sustainable agriculture to enhance the livelihood of society.', 'Furthermore, economic growth depends on investment in infrastructure.', 'However, the funding gap for both maintaining existing infrastructure and building new infrastructure is widening.', 'As a reinsurer and longterm investor, we both underwrite the projects needed from transport infrastructure to urban spaces or renewable energy infrastructure and provide capital to infrastructure projects to help narrow the financing gap.', 'Driving affordable insurance with digital solutions By embracing the opportunities offered by new technologies and the digital transformation, we aim to develop solutions that make insurance more affordable, accessible and available to customers.', 'Technology not only allows us to deliver greater efficiencies through the entire insurance value chain, but also to provide innovative insurance covers and share our risk knowledge more widely.', 'Technology can help streamline processes, which eventually leads to more customer friendly access to insurance and more affordable coverage.', 'Ultimately, we want to help close the protection gap by offering risk cover to a greater number of individuals through a simplified insurance value chain.', 'By combining smart analytics and devices we can enhance our risk knowledge as well as advice to customers to improve risk prevention, mitigation and crisis management.', 'Furthermore, customers can benefit from education and behaviour change platforms that provide advice on nutrition, exercise, sleep and other activities.', 'Swiss Re Sustainability

we take into account the views of various standardsetters on materiality, eg: reporting requirements, materiality definitions by sustainability rating agencies, multilateral discussions such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals see page , relevant academic research and regulatory developments.', 'As part of our enhanced Group Sustainability Strategy, we reviewed the materiality of our Sustainability Topics formerly Corporate Responsibility Topics.', 'In doing so, we tapped the key sources described above and conducted the following steps: • Benchmarking and gap analysis by the Group Sustainability Strategy project core team • Interviews and roundtable discussions with key internal decisionmakers • Exchanges with our sustainability risk stakeholders eg investor meetings, events at the Centre for Global Dialogue, project and businessrelated interactions and external experts academia, NGOs, consulting firms • Revised list of material topics finalised by Group Sustainability Risk unit, based on Group Sustainability Strategy and former list of material topics How we determine materiality A key question for any company that seeks to advance sustainability is what this means in the context of its own business and industry: which topics are “material” to achieving this goal?', 'In order to identify these material Sustainability Topics, we use both our internal risk expertise and ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders.', 'Insights from our internal risk expertise As a leading reinsurer, we act as ultimate risktaker in society, which requires us to have a very sound understanding of the risk landscape.', 'This risk expertise embedded in our company and the deep understanding of reinsurance markets also give us a solid foundation to identify material sustainability issues.', 'In many areas of our business, we have special teams, functions and processes to identify and address issues relevant to sustainable development.', 'We conduct this analysis through our Sustainable Business Risk Framework and other tailormade risk management tools.', 'This enables us to spot, at an early stage, newly developing or changing risks that may have a significant impact on our business, including risks related to sustainability issues.', 'Generally speaking, this dialogue works in both directions: Our partners expect us to share our risk expertise, thus helping them and society at large to form effective responses.', 'In turn, we also benefit from this exchange because it helps us sharpen our understanding of key risks, including sustainability issues, and to set priorities.', 'Complementing the insights we gain directly through dialogue with our stakeholders, we also evaluate and use data provided by specialised thirdparty organisations

same, cofounded the RE initiative.', 'With these internal measures we have played a pioneering role in the fight against climate change.', 'Today, however, climate scientists clearly state that efforts need to be reinforced: to keep global warming well below °C, the world needs to reach netzero emissions by see illustration above.', 'Put simply, netzero emissions means that for every tonne of CO that cannot be reduced yet, another tonne needs to be removed from the atmosphere and stored permanently through socalled carbon removal technologies.', 'Scientists further predict that it will take billions of tonnes of negative emissions to keep warming below °C the longer emission reduction efforts are deferred, the more.', 'Swiss Re has decided to play a leading role again in this accelerated effort to mitigate climate risk.', 'Thus, in we committed to reaching netzero emissions in our operations by .', 'This underscores our pledge to reach netzero emissions by both in our reinsurance business see page and in our investment portfolio see page .', 'To achieve netzero in our operations, we need to do two things: Firstly, we will double down on our efforts to reduce emissions.', 'As approximately % of our CO footprint stems from business travel, we will focus on flight emissions, starting with a reduction target of at least % in .', 'Afterwards, further reductions will be incentivised by ramping up our existing internal carbon price to a stringent carbon steering levy.', 'Secondly, we will start to buy impactful carbon removal certificates, which are significantly more expensive than conventional carbon offsets.', 'The latter cannot be used to substantiate a netzero emissions claim, though see page .', 'The new carbon steering levy will address both objectives at the same time cutting emissions from flights that are not absolutely needed and raising funds to support carbon removal projects.', 'Carbon removal is still a nascent industry.', 'Our early engagement will help it grow and deliver at scale by .', 'It will, however, not be feasible to buy high quality removal certificates for all our emissions immediately.', 'Any surplus funds

substantial.', 'Minimising business travel As a result of the substantial cuts we have achieved in CO emissions from power consumption and heating since , business travel easily constitutes Swiss Res largest emission source today.', 'However, we have taken several measures to reduce the need for business travel and to curb unnecessary business trips.', 'Recently, we replaced these facilities with

office space.', 'In the office buildings we own ourselves, however, we ensure that appliances meet high standards of water efficiency.', 'As paper use is more responsive to managerial action, we have taken a number of measures to reduce the average amount used by our employees in recent years.', 'New IT solutions such as “pull printing” which eliminates uncollected printouts, webbased

'Greenhouse neutrality was a thoughtleading concept at the time.', 'Carbon offset markets as we know them today did not yet exist, so Swiss Re invested in a fund specifically set up to help develop CO reduction projects and issue the resulting offsets to its investors.', 'We chose the Community Development Carbon Fund CDCF run by the World Bank, as it was the first fund designed not only to generate emission reductions, but also community benefits through the projects it finances: access to clean water, improved health conditions, creation of jobs, women empowerment and more.', 'By , carbon offset markets had matured to the point where we were able to buy enough offsets to compensate all our outstanding emissions back to .', 'Over time, labels and standards had emerged that guaranteed the quality of offsets in terms of accountability, social and environmental safeguards etc.', 'We have exclusively supported Gold Standard certified projects www.goldstandard.org, which means they have come with the same level of cobenefits as the CDCF projects.', 'To fund our offsetting campaign according to the “polluter pays” principle, in we introduced a small levy on our employees business flights.', 'In , Swiss Re committed to achieve netzero emissions in our own operations by for details, see page .', 'This major new commitment requires us to move away from conventional carbon offsets, where we pay others to avoid their emissions in our place, as this type of compensation is not enough to reach netzero emissions.', 'Instead, unavoided emissions need to be compensated through carbon removal see illustration below.', 'Netzero emissions is the thoughtleading concept of today.', 'Yet the carbon removal industry, let alone a fully fledged market for removal certificates, is still to emerge.', 'Through our early engagement we will help develop the carbon removal market by creating demand and by motivating clients and peers to join our
