rates possible, resulting in higher productivity.', 'On the other hand, it allows us to reduce energy consumption by percent and oil consumption by percent.', 'Thats huge.” For comparison, todays presses require to liters of hydraulic oil to operate, while the FB one uses to liters of oil.', 'And since the oil ages more slowly, the intervals between oil changes are longer another thing that speaks for the FB one.', 'When it comes to sustainability in mechanical engineer ing, Feintool is affected in two ways.', 'On the one hand, the company manufactures tools that operate as efficiently as possible and are therefore environmentally friendly.', 'On the other hand, Feintool is itself a user of presses and is there fore all too familiar with the needs of customers who want to save energy and disposal costs in production.', 'Andreas Walther explains: “For the FB one, we compared all our existing presses, pulled out the best features of each, and developed them further.” Because conserving resources was an important issue, a great deal of time and energy was spent working on the hydraulic concept.', 'The result is impressive, with lower energy consumption and higher per formance “Swiss designed.” Energy is also saved during waste separation.', 'Feintool carefully audited its suppliers and components and complied with all environmental standards, including RoHS Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment and the REACH guide lines for chemicals REACH stands for Registration, Evalua tion, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals.', 'Apart from the environmental aspect, the FB one is consid erably easier to operate than previous models and opens up completely new options in tool making.', 'And the new press line also

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY SUSTAINABILITY ARISES AT THE PLANT Feintool uses district heating and electric forklift trucks Sustainable business operations not only entail manufacturing eco nomical products from safe materials, but also require rethinking how the companys systems, operations, and transport processes are set up.', 'Feintool is committed to conducting its business in a sustainable manner.', 'Switching to district heating at our headquarters in Lyss, Switzerland, and to batterypowered forklift trucks at our plant in Obertshausen, Germany, are two prime examples of this.', 'Switch from natural gas to district heating Feintool reached further steps on its path to becoming more sustainable in .', 'A Feintool building on Industriering in Lyss was newly heated via district heating from the local supplier “Wärme Lyss Nord” and no longer with natural gas.', 'This investment was a reflection of Feintools decision to operate in a more resourceefficient manner and to reduce the emissions previously generated through its use of natural gas.', 'It is therefore transported by means of a water system to places where it is needed.', 'Once there, it is withdrawn via a heat exchanger and fed into a buildings heating system.', 'In the case of Feintools location at Industriering , the waste heat from industrial drying processes from the neighboring GMZ Extraktionswerk AG is used to heat the building and produce hot water.', 'As such, Feintools system is a partic ularly environmentally friendly solution and in accordance with the ISO interna tional management standard, which requires companies to continuously improve their environmental performance.', 'The Feintool lo cation in Lyss is also certified in accordance with ISO .', 'The new installation is more maintenancefriendly, spacesaving, and more sustainable than the previous heating system.', 'District heating provides us with kilowatt hours of heating capacity per year.” In comparison, Switzerlands an nual consumption per capita is approximately kilowatt hours.', 'Overall, the benefits of district heating for the environment are enormous according to the energy supplier Wärme Lyss Nord, the use of district heating can reduce CO emissions by up to tons in the area covered by the heating network.', 'Lithiumion technology for the fleet The need to make a change was obvious at the Obertshausen plant, the logistics fleet consisted of a large number of vehicles with different drive concepts from various man ufacturers.', 'The plan was to standardize this in order to cut costs and reduce the main tenance requirements, while simultaneously ensuring that the fleet of the future would be sustainable.', 'After consulting with employ ees, Feintool therefore decided to replace its previous fleet of diesel vehicles and forklifts powered by lead batteries in the first phase, the company would equip forklifts with lithiumion technology.', 'After that, it would also successively convert the hand pallet trucks.', 'This was an important step towards implementing an internal electric mobility con cept that is both environmentally friendly and easy to use, as well as cuts costs.', 'The main benefit of switching to liion bat teries consists of liters of diesel this is how much three diesel vehicles consumed each year alone before reaching the end of their lifespan.', 'In addition, this step also saved emissions that are generated when fuels are created and stored.', 'By comparison, the new forklift trucks lithiumion technolo gy is completely carbonfree, generating zero emissions.', 'Compared to leadacid batteries, the new drive systems also stand out thanks to their higher energy density and increased effectiveness.', 'This means that twice the amount of energy can be stored in
