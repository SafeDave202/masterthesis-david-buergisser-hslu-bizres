'To help inform a plan for our own ‘net zero pathway, easyJet is engaging with a ScienceBased Targets Initiative SBTi project to develop a decarbonisation trajectory and targetsetting tool specific to the aviation sector.', 'Conservation and restoration of nature is increasingly recognised as a way to achieve emissions reductions while simultaneously helping build resilience to climate change.', 'Whilst our ultimate aim is to achieve zero emissions flying in the UK and across Europe, easyJets Board decided at the start of the financial year to invest in the most effective immediate measure we could take to mitigate our carbon impact namely to offset, via investment in highquality carbon credits, % of easyJets CO footprint Scopes and .', 'We have invested exclusively in Gold Standard and Verified Carbon Standard VCS carbon credits, with around % from renewable energy projects but the majority comprise of naturebased credits e.g.', 'reforestation, afforestation, and avoided deforestation, including borehole rehabilitation and cookstoves projects in some of the most intense deforestation hotspots around the world.', 'Not only are these projects effective in reducing deforestation, but they also work with local communities to deliver programmes for alternative income generation which incentivises the protection of forests over the long term.', 'Whilst the voluntary carbon offset market is increasingly recognised as having major potential to contribute towards limiting global warming, it remains relatively small and unregulated.', 'For this reason we were pleased to be invited to join the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, an initiative launched by Mark Carney, the former Governor of the Bank of England, in September , and sponsored by the Institute of International Finance.', 'This initiative aims to facilitate the rapid scaling and maturing of this market.', 'Our customers also support our offsetting work.', 'There are higher satisfaction rates and brand preference for easyJet among those customers who are aware that the fuel emissions from their flights have been offset.', 'This includes adjusting standard operating procedures, which helps to reduce fuel usage and therefore carbon emissions.', 'All measures are taken only when safe and practical to do so, within the constraints of the operational environment.', 'Initiatives include: • The use of singleengine taxi on arrival and departure • Reducing the use of aircraft flaps on the approach to landing, to reduce drag • Using advanced weather information to improve navigation performance inflight, which optimises routing by avoiding poor weather and headwinds • The use of engine washing to remove debris, which improves the air turbine efficiency.', 'This year we carried out approximately engine washes • Reviewing and optimising the amount of discretionary fuel uplifted on each flight.', 'This financial year we have reduced the amount of discretionary fuel on each flight by an average of kg compared to the financial year.', 'Captains always have the final decision on the fuel required for flight and safety remains the highest priority • Optimisation of the climb speed on takeoff to get to cruise altitude, which facilitates reaching a more fuel efficient phase of flight sooner • The use of ground power by our aircraft when onstand at

Directors considered the reliability of forecast information, duration and impact of COVID and longerterm management incentives.', 'The assessment of the prospects of the Group includes the following factors: • The strategic plan which takes into consideration market conditions, future commitments, cash flow, funding requirements and maturity of existing financing facilities • The fleet plan the plan retains some flexibility to adjust the size of the fleet in response to opportunities or risks • Strength of the balance sheet and unencumbered assets this sustainable strength gives us access to

'easyJets response to the pandemic has been quick and decisive in order to reduce costs and maximise cash retention, with liquidity and cost control continuing to be a key focus.', 'The easyJet flying programme continues to evolve, factoring in customer demand and travel restriction guidance, in order to target positive contribution.', 'The long term easyJet business model is robust, as demonstrated by the strong financial position before the pandemic.', 'The consolidated easyJet plc Group continues to maintain unencumbered aircraft worth in excess of £.', 'billion, and a large and

combination of some or all of these potential risks, or if the impact of the pandemic is significantly more prolonged or severe than modelled by the Directors, will result in management action being required to secure ongoing liquidity for the business.', 'GOING CONCERN STATEMENT After reviewing the current liquidity position, financial forecasts, stress testing of potential risks and considering the uncertainties described below, and based on the current funding facilities outlined, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.', 'For these reasons the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Group financial statements.', 'Although the combination of severe but plausible downside potential risks are not considered likely, in the event that some or all of these occur the Group may need to secure additional funding to ensure the business meets its obligations for the next months, which is not contractually committed at the date of this report.', 'Sources of additional funding include the use of unencumbered aircraft to support further financing.', 'However, the occurrence of multiple downside potential risks, including cash collateralisation of unearned revenue by card acquirers and easyJets ability to obtain additional funding represents a material uncertainty at November that could cast significant doubt upon the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.', 'The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group were unable to continue as a going concern.', 'VIABILITY STATEMENT Based on the assessment performed, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet all liabilities as they fall due up to September .', 'easyJet has access to a variety of funding options including capital markets, aircraft financing and bank or government debt.', 'In assessing viability, it is assumed that the detailed risk management process as outlined on pages to captures all plausible risks, and

have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts • prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and Company will continue in business.', 'The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Groups and the Companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and the Company.', 'This enables them to ensure that the accounts and the Directors Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act and, as regards the Group accounts, Article of the IAS Regulation.', 'They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.', 'We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Accounts the “Annual Report”,

for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.', 'MATERIAL UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO GOING CONCERN GROUP AND COMPANY In forming our opinion on the Group and Company financial statements, which is not modified, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosure made in note to the financial statements and on page of the Annual Report concerning the Groups and Companys ability to continue as a going concern.', 'The Groups forecast and projections assume a continued phased increase in flying which represents a significant reduction to historic revenue levels, along with cost saving measures and reductions in capital expenditure.', 'After making enquiries and considering the uncertainties described on page , the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company has access to adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.', 'For these reasons, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.', 'As described on page , the occurrence of such severe but plausible events and the availability of additional financing represents a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt upon the Groups and Companys ability to continue as a going concern.', 'The Group and Company financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if they were was unable to continue as a going concern.', 'OUR AUDIT APPROACH Overview • Overall Group materiality: £.m, based on % of headline loss before tax, capped at £.m : £.m, based on % of profit before tax.', '• Overall Company materiality: £.m : £.m, based on % of total assets, capped at % of Group Materiality materiality.', '• We performed full scope audit procedures over the Company and one individually significant component in the Group.', 'Procedures over material financial statements lines were performed for two further components.', '• This provided coverage of % of both external revenue and loss before tax Key audit matters • Aircraft maintenance provision Group.', '• Discontinuation of hedge accounting Group.', '• Risk of fraud arising from cyberattack Group and Company.', 'CAPABILITY OF THE AUDIT IN DETECTING IRREGULARITIES, INCLUDING FRAUD Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of noncompliance with laws and regulations related to easyJets Air Travel Organisers Licence being revoked, breaches of the current EU Emissions Trading System requirements or other environmental regulations, adherence to data protection requirements in the jurisdictions in which easyJet operates and holds data, UK and overseas tax legislation not being adhered to and noncompliance with employment regulations in the UK and other jurisdictions in which the Group operates, and we considered the extent to which noncompliance might have a material effect on the financial statements.', 'We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act and Listing Rules.', 'We evaluated managements incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements including the risk of override of controls, and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries, either in the underlying books and records or as part of the consolidation process, and management bias in accounting estimates.', 'Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and or component auditor included: • Discussions with management, internal audit and the Groups legal team, including consideration of known or suspected instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations and fraud; • Reading key correspondence from the FRC; • Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in its significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.', 'Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.', 'KEY AUDIT MATTERS Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement whether or not due to fraud identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.', 'These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.', 'Valuation of restructuring provisions, discontinuation of hedge accounting, risk of fraud arising from cyberattack and impact of the Covid pandemic are new key audit matters this year.', 'Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year.', 'easyJet plc Annual Report and Accounts Key audit matter AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE PROVISION GROUP The Group operates aircraft which are held under lease arrangements and for which it incurs liabilities for maintenance costs during the term of the lease.', 'Maintenance provisions of £m : £m for aircraft maintenance costs in respect of leased aircraft were recorded in the financial statements at September .', 'DISCONTINUATION OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING GROUP The Group utilises derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to transaction currency risk, jet fuel price risk and interest rate risks arising from its highly probable forecast payments in foreign currencies, purchases of jet fuel and debt repayments.', 'In accordance with IFRS , the Group has elected to apply cash flow hedge accounting for its foreign exchange and jet fuel derivatives.', 'Based on reforecast activity levels, the Group no longer expects to incur foreign currency payments or to consume jet fuel at the volumes that were initially forecast.', 'We have focused on this area because of the significant level of judgement required to be exercised by management in determining the revised estimates of foreign currency payments and jet fuel usage and the subsequent impact on the quantum of assessment of whether the hedge is required to be discontinued, as well as their materiality to the financial position and financial performance of the Group for the year ended September .', 'How our audit addressed the key audit matter • We evaluated the maintenance provision model and tested the calculations therein.', 'Our testing has focussed on the most material elements of the net charge, being the discontinuation charges arising on dedesignation of hedges for jet fuel and payments in foreign currencies totalling £m.', '• We agreed that the revised forecasts used by easyJet for the assessment of future hedge effectiveness were consistent with Board approved forecasts used for other judgements and that sufficient and appropriate trades related to over hedged positions have been discontinued based on the original forecast cash flows and the reforecast cash flows reflecting the impact of the ongoing pandemic.', '• We assessed the method by which management identified the specific trades to be dedesignated from the total portfolio in each month for the period to August .', 'We also reconciled the amounts recycled from the cash flow hedge reserve to the income statement based on the trades which were dedesignated.', 'The impact of applying reasonable alternative cash flow assumptions in these periods was not material.',

OF INTANGIBLE AND AIRCRAFT RELATED GROUP At September , the aggregate value of goodwill and landing rights, which are both assessed to have indefinite lives, amounted to £ million : £ million.', '• We evaluated and challenged the future cash flow forecasts of the CGU, and the At September , the aggregate value of aircraft and spares, the principal tangible assets utilised by the business in its operations, amounted to £,m : £,m.', 'All goodwill, landing rights and aircraft and spares belong to a single cashgenerating unit “CGU”, being easyJets route network, and a single value in use “VIU” calculation is performed in order to assess their recoverability.', 'These estimates include key assumptions underpinning the strategic fiveyear plan, fuel prices, exchange rates, longterm economic growth rates and discount rates.', 'process by which the forecasts were drawn up, and we tested the underlying value in use calculations.', '• We recalculated managements own sensitivity analysis of key assumptions used in the VIU assessment and also performed our own independent sensitivity analysis by replacing key assumptions with alternative scenarios in order to ascertain the extent of change in those assumptions that either individually or collectively would be required for the goodwill and landing rights to be impaired.', '• We assessed the basis by which management identified the leased assets that will no longer be utilised by the business and recalculated the impairment.', 'Through review of the future flying forecasts we assessed whether there were any further assets that should be impaired as a result of contraction of the business.', '• For engineering spares, we challenged management in respect of assets which appeared to have low utilisation levels that may be at risk of being impaired.', 'Based on the work performed, as summarised above, we have concluded that the carrying value of goodwill, landing rights, aircraft and spares at September is materially correct.', 'We also tested any settled elements of the associated restructuring costs to actual cash settlements with employees to ensure that element of the liability has been appropriately extinguished.', 'easyJet plc Annual Report and Accounts Key audit matter RISK OF FRAUD ARISING FROM CYBERATTACK GROUP AND COMPANY During the year the Group was the target of a cyberattack where its network was infiltrated by an external party and large amounts of passenger data was accessed from some operational systems.', 'How our audit addressed the key audit matter We focused on this area as there is a risk that the Groups financial systems have been accessed and that their integrity has therefore been compromised with the consequent possibility of fraudulent misstatement of financial information in the financial statements.', 'We have also assessed whether, based on the current status of the Information Commissioners Office investigation and ongoing matters of litigation, there is any means to reliably estimate any fines and penalties which may arise as a result of this incident.', 'www.easyJet.com FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF EASYJET PLC CONTINUED How our audit addressed the key audit matter Key audit matter IMPACT OF THE COVID PANDEMIC GROUP AND COMPANY Since the outbreak of Covid the Group and Company have continued to operate and trade, albeit including a period when the entire fleet was grounded and with extended periods of significantly reduced flying when compared to historic levels.', 'This reduction in flying has continued into the first quarter of the year ended September .', 'We focussed on areas where significant additional audit effort might be required as well as those areas which might be susceptible to a material financial impact on the performance and position of the Group or Company for the year ended September .', 'There is a risk that the financial impact arising from Covid which has been recorded by management is inappropriate or that we might not able to obtain sufficient audit evidence in order to support our conclusions in respect of this assessment.', '• Where relevant, suitable downside scenarios were modelled by management in the cash flow models used to assess for possible impairments of intangible and tangible assets impairment.', 'We challenged managements key cash flow assumptions by performing our own sensitivity analysis.', 'We concur with the Boards conclusion to adopt the going concern basis of preparation for the financial statements at September .', '• We have assessed deferred tax assets for recoverability based on projected future forecasts which are aligned with the Board approved fiveyear plan.', 'Based on our work, which included performing sensitivities, we concluded that these assets appear to be recoverable within a reasonable time horizon.', '• Despite undertaking most of our year end work remotely, we did not encounter any significant difficulties in performing our audit testing or in obtaining the required evidence to support our audit conclusions We reviewed the disclosures in the financial statements in respect of the impact of Covid and concluded that these are appropriate.', 'Based on the work performed, as summarised above, we have concluded that the Groups conclusions in respect of the impact of Covid are appropriate.', 'The Group operates through the Company and its thirteen subsidiary undertakings of which eight were actively trading through the year.', 'Under our direction and supervision some financial statement line items identified in our scope were audited by a component team from PwC Switzerland.', 'The testing approach ensured that appropriate audit evidence was obtained over all financial statement line items in order to support our opinion on the Consolidated financial statements as a whole.', 'Based on the detailed audit work performed across the Group, we have obtained coverage of % of both external consolidated revenue and loss before tax.', 'easyJet plc Annual Report and Accounts MATERIALITY The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality.', 'We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.', 'Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: Overall materiality £.m : £.m.', 'Group financial statements How we determined it Rationale for benchmark applied Based on % of headline loss before tax, capped at £.m.', 'However, given the context of this years headline loss before tax, we capped the level of overall materiality at £.m, in line with the level used in the previous year.', 'In determining this benchmark, we also considered other approaches to materiality which could have reasonably been applied including the use of thresholds based on revenue or net asset measures.', 'In the previous year, a benchmark set at % of statutory profit before tax was used to determine overall materiality.', 'No cap to materiality was applied in the previous year.', 'Company financial statements £.m : £.m.', 'Based on % of total assets, capped at % of Group materiality.', 'The value is capped at % of the Group overall materiality.', 'For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality.', 'The range of materiality allocated across components was between £,, and £,,.', 'We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality.', 'Our performance materiality was % of overall materiality, amounting to £.m for the Group financial statements and £.m for the parent company financial statements.', 'In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls and concluded that an amount in the middle of our normal range was appropriate.', 'GOING CONCERN In accordance with ISAs UK we report as follows: Reporting obligation We

'Under the simplified approach easyJet always recognises a loss allowance for a financial asset at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.', 'Interest expense on borrowings is recognised using the effective interest method.', 'Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost include trade and other payables, lease liabilities and borrowings.', 'easyJet uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency risks on transactions denominated in US dollars, Euros, Swiss francs and South African rand.', 'These transactions primarily affect revenue, fuel, fixed costs, and the carrying value of owned aircraft.', 'easyJet also uses crosscurrency interest rate swaps to hedge currency and interest rate risk on certain borrowings, and jet fuel forward swap and option contracts to hedge fuel price risks.', 'SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED FAIR VALUE HEDGES Changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair values of the hedged assets or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk.', 'Such fair value changes are recognised through other comprehensive income as cost of hedging, and are recycled to profit or loss on a rational basis, according to the nature of the underlying hedged item.', 'All foreign exchange contracts in a cash flow hedge relationship are designated on a forward basis with the full fair value as the hedge instrument.', 'The time value element of the full fair value for these derivatives is recognised through other comprehensive income as a Cost of Hedging and recycled to profit or loss as the same time as hedge item also impacts profit and loss.', 'Such fair value changes are recognised through other comprehensive income as a Cost of Hedging, and are recycled to profit or loss on a rational basis, according to the nature of the underlying hedged item.', 'All other changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.', 'When the hedged forecast transaction relates to an item of property, plant and equipment, the relevant accumulated gains and losses are transferred from the hedging reserve and included in the initial carrying amount of that purchased asset.', 'In the event that a hedged forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, any related gains and losses are immediately transferred from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement.', 'through expiry, disposal or termination of a derivative, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.', 'Where the hedged item continues to be expected to occur, the related gains and losses remain deferred in the hedging reserve until the transaction takes place.', 'There is no change to the previous accounting policy in relation to existing Airline revenues.', 'easyJet categorises total revenue earned on the face of the income statement between passenger and ancillary revenue.', 'Passenger revenue arises from the sale of flight seats and administration fees and is measured as the price paid by the customer.', 'Passenger revenue is recognised when the performance obligation has been completed.', 'Amounts paid by ‘noshow customers are recognised as passenger revenue when the booked service is provided, as such customers are not generally entitled to change flights or seek refunds once a flight has departed.', 'Ancillary revenue includes revenue from the provision of checked baggage, allocated seating and change fees, package holidays revenue excluding flights which are recognised as passenger revenue and revenue arising from commissions earned from services sold on behalf of partners and inflight sales.', 'Airline flights and package holiday deposits are paid for at the point of booking.', 'Package holiday balances due from customers are offset against the customers deferred revenue until paid in full, due days before departure.', 'Unearned revenue from flights not yet flown is held in the statement of financial position until it is realised in the income statement when the performance obligation is complete.', 'Unearned revenue also includes nonflight elements of package holidays for which the customer has paid but has not yet taken place, and is held in the statement of financial position until it is realised in the income statement when the performance obligation is complete.', 'Vouchers issued by easyJet in lieu of refunds are held on the balance sheet in other payables until they are redeemed against a new booking, at which point they are recognised as unearned revenue.', 'easyJet plc Annual Report and Accounts easyJet plc Annual Report and Accounts If easyJet cancels a flight or holiday, unless a customer immediately rebooks on an alternative flight or holiday, at the point of the cancellation the amount paid for the flight is derecognised from unearned revenue and a financial liability is recognised within Trade and other payables to refund the customer.', 'Some of the compensation payments made to customers in respect of flight delays are offset against revenues recognised up to the amount of the flight, with the excess compensation being recorded within expenses.', 'Revenue from easyJet plus cards is recognised evenly over time in line with when the performance obligations are expected to arise.', 'Revenue from easyJet plus cards for the current financial year totalled £ million : £ million.', 'INCOME STATEMENT COST PRESENTATION A cost line has been a in the consolidated income statement for airports, ground handling and other operating costs, which now merges the existing airport and ground handling costs with holidays direct operating costs.', 'The holidays direct operating costs represent all direct operating costs relating to package holidays excluding flight costs, which are eliminated on consolidation.', 'Holidays direct costs are recognised at the end of the holiday, on the inbound flight date which is consistent with the nonflight elements of package holiday revenue.', 'Under the new structure the Chief Operating Decision Maker has been assessed as the easyJet plc Board, which receives regular reporting on the Airline and Holidays results in order to make resource allocation decisions.', 'The holidays business has been identified as a separate operating segment meaning the Group now has two operating segments, being the Airline business which operates easyJets route network and the holidays business, which sells holiday packages.', 'Geographic revenue is allocated on the following bases: • revenue earned from customers is allocated according to the location of the first departure airport on each booking; and • commission revenue earned from partners is allocated according to the domicile of each partner.', 'Passenger revenue recognised within the Airline segment includes intrasegment sales of flights to the holidays segment.', 'Passenger revenue is recognised in the Airline segment when the flight takes place.', 'ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR CARBON OFFSETTING AND VERIFIED EMISSION REDUCTIONS In November easyJet announced a voluntary policy to compensate for every tonne of carbon and carbon equivalents collectively ‘carbon emitted from fuel used for all its flights, by investing in projects which will mean there is one tonne less in the atmosphere whether by reducing carbon by physically removing it from the air or by avoiding the release of additional carbon.', 'easyJet purchases Verified Emission Reductions VERs arising from Gold Standard or Verified Carbon Standard VCS accredited projects to offset the carbon emitted from flights.', 'The cost of purchasing VERs is recognised in the income statement when the flight occurs with a corresponding carbon offsetting liability.', 'This is measured using the purchase price of VERs on a First In First Out basis, then a weighted average of expected future purchases where all purchased VERs have been allocated.', 'VERs are recorded as an asset at historic cost when delivery into the easyJet registry account has taken place.', 'At regular intervals the VERs are retired to settle the obligation, at which point the VER asset and carbon offsetting liability are derecognised.', 'VOLUNTARY CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY PRESENTATION OF CARBON ASSETS With the introduction of the voluntary carbon offset policy, easyJet has reviewed the most appropriate presentation for assets held to settle this liability, and the presentation of assets purchased and held to settle the requirements under the EU Emissions Trading System ETS.', 'The prior year ETS asset balance of £ million has therefore been reclassified from trade and other receivables to current intangible assets in the comparative statement of financial position as at September to be consistent with this new presentation.', 'The cash flows associated with the purchase of carbon credit assets are classified as operating cash flows, as these are cash outflows for an activity which is treated as an operating expense in the consolidated income statement.', 'This has resulted in a similar reclassification of the reconciliation of operating loss to cash generated from operations seen in note .', 'The amount moved from changes in trade and other receivables to change in current intangible assets was £ million.', 'The underlying accounting treatment remains unchanged for carbon assets.', 'Purchased carbon credits are recognised at the purchase price and are not subsequently revalued as they are held for own use.', 'The impact on the October balance sheet is as follows: Noncurrent assets Trade and other receivables Intangible assets Current assets Current

grant will be received.', 'All existing loans are considered to be at market value.', 'Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the income statement in the relevant financial statement line on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses are recognised to present the net expense to the Group.', 'NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS IFRIC has been adopted as at October with no material impact.', 'easyJet have applied the practical expedient under COVID Related Rent Concessions Amendment to IFRS Leases which has been early adopted.', 'In particular, the amendment provides temporary relief to allow hedge accounting to continue during the transition period before IBOR based hedge items or instruments are amended as a result of the reform being completed.', 'The Group has elected to early adopt this amendment, applying it retrospectively to accounting relationships that existed before the start of the current reporting period.', 'Specifically the amendment impacts the fair value hedge relationship on one of the Groups Eurobonds, where a crosscurrency interest rate swap with a sterling notional of £ million, maturity of February and a fair value of £ million in an asset position is used to swap the fixed interest coupon of the euro denominated debt into a floating interest rate, reset quarterly using future expected GBP LIBOR.', 'In assessing hedge effectiveness on a prospective basis for this relationship, the Group has assumed that the GBPLIBOR related interest cash flows on the swap are not altered by IBOR reform and the hedge continues to be highly effective.', 'Furthermore, hedge accounting did not need to be discontinued during the period of IBORrelated uncertainty as the Group has taken the relief available in Phase to separately identify the risk component at the initial hedge designation and not on an ongoing basis.', 'In preparation of the reform transition date, expected at the end of the Group anticipates being required to make amendments to the contractual terms of this swap and to update its hedge designation as appropriate.', 'The Group is not early adopting these amendments as the current hedge relationship is continuing and no amendments have been made to the hedged item andor hedging instruments in the financial year.', 'CLASSIFICATION OF INCOME OR EXPENSES BETWEEN HEADLINE AND NONHEADLINE ITEMS NOTE The Group seeks to present a measure of underlying performance which is not impacted by material nonrecurring items or items which are not considered to be reflective of the trading performance of the business.', 'Items relating to the normal trading performance of the business will always be included within the headline performance.', 'VOUCHERS ISSUED Due to the amount of cancelled flights in the year easyJet offered customers the option to accept vouchers in lieu of cash refunds.', 'The liability for vouchers is classified as other payables until the voucher is redeemed against a future booking when it is reclassified to unearned revenue.', 'SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS Judgement is required when determining if sale and leaseback proceeds and lease rentals are at fair value.', 'The sale and leaseback transactions completed in the year have been assessed with reference to external valuations specific to the easyJet fleet and deemed to be at fair value.', 'AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE PROVISIONS £ MILLION NOTE easyJet incurs liabilities for maintenance costs in respect of aircraft leased during the term of the lease.', 'To discharge these obligations, easyJet will also normally need to carry out one heavy maintenance check on each of the engines and the airframe during the lease term.', 'The most critical estimates required for the provision are considered to be the utilisation of the aircraft, the expected costs of the heavy maintenance checks at the time which they are expected to occur, the condition of the aircraft, the lifespan of lifelimited parts and the rate used to discount the provision.', 'The bases of all estimates are reviewed at least annually, and when information becomes available that is capable of causing a material change to an estimate, such as renegotiation of end of lease return conditions, increased or decreased utilisation, or changes in the cost of heavy maintenance services.', 'A % movement in the estimated cost of final maintenance events would result in a £ million movement to the provision.', 'PROVISIONS FOR CUSTOMER CLAIMS £ MILLION NOTE easyJet incurs liabilities for amounts payable to customers who make claims in respect of flight delays and cancellations, and refunds of air passenger duty or similar charges.', 'Assumptions are required to estimate the cost of providing welfare payments for those customers impacted.', 'GOODWILL AND LANDING RIGHTS £ MILLION NOTE The recoverable amount of goodwill and landing rights has been determined based on value in use calculations for the airline route network cash generating unit.', 'The value in use is determined by discounting future cash flows to their present value.', 'When applying this method, easyJet relies on a number of key estimates including the ability to meet its strategic plans, future fuel prices and exchange rates, longterm economic growth rates for the principal countries in which it operates, and its pretax weighted average cost of capital.', 'Strategic plans include estimations of the future impact of climate change on easyJet to the extent these can be forecast.', 'This includes, for example, estimates made for the future cost to easyJet of emitting carbon.', 'The impact of longer term future developments such as electric aircraft development or availability of sustainable aviation fuels have been

of the reduced customer demand, leased aircraft were permanently stood down from commercial service and will be returned to the lessors at the end of the lease term.', 'No goodwill has been allocated
