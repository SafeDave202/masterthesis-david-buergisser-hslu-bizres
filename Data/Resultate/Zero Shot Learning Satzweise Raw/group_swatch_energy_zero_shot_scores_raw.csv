MATERIAL SOURCING Environmental, ethical, and social criteria are an integral part of our sourcing policy, which is why only suppliers and subsuppliers that fully comply with our clearly defined and contractually docu mented criteria on safety, environmental and sociopolitical aspects can be considered.', 'This involves not only compliance with national and international laws, but also encompasses the OECD guidelines for raw material and component sourcing OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains from Conflict Affected and HighRisk Areas and its Supplement on Gold and Standard SA Social Accountability International on responsible and ethical sourcing of material.', 'These standards require sourcing under the premise of ethical and fair working conditions, health protection and occupational safety, respect for human rights including the abovementioned zerotolerance policy with regard to forced or child labor and dealings with business partners, including the supply chain, local development and other socially and environmen tally relevant factors.', 'Only nonendangered and ethically sound ma terials are used.', 'In addition, suppliers must, at a minimum, fulfill the internal guidelines of Swatch Group Quality Management, any ecological and legal regulations, and ensure legal compliance in terms of products, particularly REACH Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authoriza tion and Restriction of Chemicals, RoHS Restriction of Hazardous Substances and WEEE Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment.', 'To ensure this, every supplier receives direct and secure access to the Swatch Group Quality Management conformity specifications for raw materials and substances.', 'SGQM is currently im plementing a new IT tool to collect and digitize Material Safety Data Sheets SDGS from more than raw material suppliers, with in structions on use and protection of health and the environment.', 'The database will contain information on more than chemical substances used in Swatch Group companies, and ensure safe han dling, storage and disposal.', 'Swatch Group FEPS Far East Procurement Service and SGQM continually verify that suppliers are effectively fulfilling the condi tions.', 'The supplier review process is clearly defined and covers the following elements: Swatch Group supplier contract, compli ance with SA conditions, compliance with all local laws and directives relating to labor law, safety and environmental protec tion, compliance with ISO , and compliance with EU laws and directives, in particular RoHS and REACH.', 'The audit procedures are divided into the following six subject areas: compliance with labor law and control of working conditions, health and safety at work Occupational Health Safety, OHS, environmental pro tection, legal product conformity, verification of compliance with the supply contract and the quality of planning, and verification of the quality management system.', 'FEPS determines which suppli ers will be audited during a financial year, commissions an audit ing company to carry out an audit in accordance with the require ments and then analyzes the report.', 'The cycle ensures that all suppliers are audited within three years.', 'New suppliers are checked immediately.', 'Suppliers receive an A rating very good if over % of the test points are fulfilled overall and more than % of the test points are fulfilled in the various subject areas, and a B rating qualified if at least % of the test points are fulfilled overall and % of the test points are fulfilled in the three subject areas of labor law, OHS and environmental protection.', 'For some inspection points, such as noncompliance with local laws, human rights, forced or child labor, the
