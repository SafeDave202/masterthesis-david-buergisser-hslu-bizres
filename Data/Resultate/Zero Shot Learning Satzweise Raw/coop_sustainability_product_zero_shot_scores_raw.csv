our members, we are even more familiar with the needs of the one million or so customers who shop with us each day in Switzer land alone.', 'If they want environmentally and socially responsible products, we strive to meet this need with our range of sustainable products.', 'Sustainabil ity can only work if lots of people recognize the need for sustainable behaviour and actually live out this behaviour in their everyday lives and the way they consume resources.', 'We therefore see it as our task to give our customers a deeper understanding of sustainability and the commitment of the numerous people behind these products.', 'The communication projects financed by the Coop Sustainability Fund are intended to promote sus tainable consumption specifically by raising con sumer awareness.', 'We support campaigns run by our partner organizations, which include the WWF and the Swiss Federal Office of Energy.', 'Ultimately, however, sustain able products have to be enjoyable

comparable retailers with complete ranges.', 'In particular, the percentage of Fairtrade products increased significantly as a result of converting the entire range of rice, chocolate bars and exotic fruit.', 'The efforts of Coops own manufacturing compa nies also helped to supply the Group with sustain able products.', 'These companies are also success fully selling sustainable products in thirdparty markets in Switzerland and elsewhere, and are thus able to differentiate themselves from their competi tors.', 'Since its acquisition of the Transgourmet Group, Coop has been investigating areas in which sustainable products might also be significant in the international wholesale market.', 'All Transgour met Group companies will also be formulating a sustainability strategy.', 'It is Coops aim for its entire product range to ultimately meet sustainability requirements.', 'In the year under review, Coop has therefore revised its supplier Quality Agreement and its Guideline on Sustainable Sourcing.', 'The Quality Agreement lays down the minimum quality, environmental and social standards for the entire product range, including in ternal purchasing.', 'The Guide line on Sustainable Sourcing lays down the indepth requirements for Coopbranded formats and for Coop manufacturing companies, and is indicative for all other Coop sales formats.', 'Coop regularly recognizes particular efforts in this field by awarding the Natura Prize.', 'The nuclear reactor accident in Japan has led to a global rethink in the energy debate.', 'Coops efforts to reduce energy consumption, promote the use of renewable energy and become COneutral by as part of its energy CO vision are increasingly proving to be meaningful and necessary from a busi ness point of view.', 'Coop manufacturing companies and Transgourmet Group companies are therefore also attaching great importance to these issues.', 'Sustainability and profitability are not mutually ex clusive in fact, they are becoming increasingly interdependent.', 'The ongoing erosion of retail trade margins means that sustainability goals will increas ingly have to focus on areas where significant lever age can be achieved, and conflicting objectives will have to be discussed more openly with stakeholders.', 'What is important is to involve the entire value chain in improvement efforts and also to use international standards to avoid duplication.', 'Focusing efforts Coop is focusing its sustainability efforts on areas that are not only characterized by a high degree of social expectation, but are also of major signifi cance with regard to costs, security of supply or market differentiation from an internal point of view.', 'Some issues, such as climate change, the efficient use of energy and water, reducing packaging, and also waste and recycling issues, are relevant in all areas retail, production and wholesale.', 'This also applies to food and product safety, dealing appropriately with Coops own employees and those in the supply chain, and to transparency and traceability re quirements.', 'Public expectations for products with specific added value such as organic, Fairtrade, regional, animal welfare and GMOfree products are far higher in retail than in wholesale.', 'In the wholesale trade, customers are generally less pre pared to pay extra and the potential for market dif ferentiation is smaller.', 'Societys expectations are less pronounced when it comes to manufacturing companies, although market differentiation can still be achieved perfectly well via sustainable product ranges.', 'Outside the retail trade, the gen eral public is also less likely to directly demand supply chain transparency, adherence to minimum requirements and the protection of forests by means of certified raw materials such as soya, palm oil and wood pulp.', 'In this case, whole salers and manufacturing companies benefit from the experience and networks that Coop has built up in its capacity as a retailer.', 'Sustainability relevance table Coop is the world champion Prof. Dr. Thomas Dyllick University of St. Gallen, Institute for Economy and the Environment “ In June , Munichs renowned independent rating agency Oekom Research AG declared Coop to be the most sustainable retailer in the world.', 'Coop should be rightly proud of this accolade.', 'This rating means cus tomers can be certain that Coops sustainability prom ises are believable.', 'For Coop, it means that the Groups many years of commitment are bearing fruit and receiv ing recognition.', 'However, the rating has also high lighted areas in which Coop still needs to take action, for example in reducing the environmental impact of packaging.', 'This is a subject that Coop has addressed directly in .” Strategic and operational controlling Coop strategically monitors the implementation of sustainability via specific key performance indicators on balanced scorecards.', 'Achieving targets in all three

Integrated brand and corporate communication on sustainability Sustainable products services Resource efficiency climate protection Employees society Processes and tools In order to monitor the implementation of standards and guidelines in the supply chain, Coop is working towards implementing a supplier database that will enable all suppliers to be rated based on various criteria including quality and sustainability.', 'Collabo ration with purchasing offices in the Far East, Italy and Spain is important for this purpose.', 'Compatibil ity between different systems is a basic prerequisite for the efficient implementation of sustainability within current processes.', 'At a later date, Coop also intends to include Transgourmet Group suppliers in its monitoring process.', 'Coop Sustainability Fund Integration into the sustainability strategy The Coop Sustainability Fund acts as a central tool for fostering innovation and raising public aware ness, with the aim of promoting sustainable con sumption.', 'So that this objective exerts the maxi mum influence in all business segments, the Fund has been integrated into the top level of the sus tainability strategy.', 'This reorientation enables the Funds financial resources to be used in all business segments and be more closely aligned with the Coop value chain.', 'The Fund is therefore able to pro mote sustainable consumption where Coop, as a retailer, has the greatest leverage and expertise in its own core business.', 'Processes and decisionmaking channels To ensure that Fund projects are relevant to Coop itself, innovative ideas for projects are being gener ated from within Coops own ranks as well as by its business partners.', 'The strict selection criteria used are defined in the Coop Sustainability Funds updat ed guidelines.', 'And it must generally not be possible to implement them without startup funding from the Coop Sustainabil ity Fund.', 'This means the Fund cannot cover any ongoing operating costs, including those of organi zations.', 'Integrating the Fund more closely into the Group has already proved fruitful in , leading to the targeted use of financial resources with the launch of exciting new projects.', 'Tools and projects Sustainable consumption is being promoted via communication projects targeted at the general public.', 'Coop is also supporting the provision of a sustainable product range via innovative projects.', 'The Funds financial resources are being split between these two approaches.', 'The profile of sustainable consumption is being raised through pointofsale tasting sessions, exhibitions, bro chures and media coverage.', 'As a counterpart to this, innovative projects are generating possible ways of designing sustainable product ranges in a manner that is competitive and also conforms with market requirements.', 'They form the basis for the ongoing development of Coops ownlabel sustainability brands and quality labels, and are therefore a prerequisite for positive sales trends in this segment.', 'Stakeholder dialogue Regular exchanges in all areas Coop has for many years been holding an intensive dialogue with relevant stakeholders from all three sustainability pillars.', 'In pillar one, these specifically include the WWF, label organizations such as Max Havelaar and Bio Suisse, initiatives in the fields of food and health, the Swiss animal welfare organi zation STS and the Business Social Compliance Initiative BSCI.', 'Coop also engages in dialogue with semipublic organizations such as the Business Energy Agency EnAW and Swiss recy cling organizations, which also make an important contribution to increasing implementation expertise in the field of corporate ecology.', 'In pillar three, the focus is on social partnership and an intensive dialogue with trade unions.', 'Since labour markets and legislation vary from country to country, differ ent forms of social dialogue will develop.', 'From a social perspective, the focus in both retail and wholesale is on working with social institutions that supply the needy with edible expired food.', 'The manufacturing companies support this important cause with fixed donations, and Coop has played a pioneering role in tackling food waste in this way.', 'Actively involving delegates As a cooperative, Coops stakeholders also include its delegates from six regions.', 'Coops Board of Directors and Executive Committee maintain close contact with these delegates by attending the meet ings of local boards, Regional Councils and their committees.', 'Topics included Coops sales formats, logistics, marketing and pur chasing, real estate, sustainability and Transgour met.', 'Fruitful exchange of experiences with Coop Frank Seipelt Managing Director Rewe Foodservice “ Rewe Foodservice is very aware of its responsibility towards societys diverse expectations regarding sustainability in a world of global markets.', 'An ongoing dialogue with internal and external stakeholders is laying the foundations for understanding the complex interrelationships involved in sustainability, deriving from these the needs of vari ous groups of social stakeholders, and harmonizing these needs with our own requirements.', 'We are greatly looking forward to a fruitful exchange of experiences with Coop and are certain we will receive dedicated support in the pragmatic implementation of the rel evant requirements.', 'This will lead to improved social interaction and more sustainable activity in an in creasingly complex world.” Targets Defining new mediumterm targets Coop published its first sustainability report in .', 'In its Sustainability Report, the compa ny was already transparently presenting its targets, measures taken and an estimated degree of attain ment.', 'It drew up new mediumterm targets in .', 'These were based on the sustain ability relevance table, took account of stake hol ders interests and were agreed by the Executive Committee.', 'The acquisition of the Transgourmet Group and the increasing involvement of manufac turing companies in sustainability reporting make it necessary to expand this process to include specific targets for these two business areas.', 'Target attainment in In , Coop was able to make progress in the following three areas in particular: incorporating sustainability targets into the annual Coop goal setting process; implementing its CO vision, in cluding reducing energy consumption and switching to renewable energy; and screening product ranges for environmental and social risks, including setting initial targets and developing initial projects.', 'Coop Strategy and organization Coop Group Sustainability Report can be particularly proud of the degree to which it has achieved targets concerning the promotion of sustainable consumption.', 'Task areas, targets and procedures have been defined for reducing and optimizing packaging.', 'With regard to sustainable customer mobility, Coop is examining various possible approaches together with EnergieSchweiz and the Coop Nordwestschweiz Sales Region, which it will subsequently be possible to disseminate more widely.',

enables Coop to initiate innovative solutions that are socially relevant and environmentally friendly, making a pioneering con tribution towards sustainability.', 'But to generate the maximum possible benefit for society, innovative products and services not only need to be provided but also communicated.', 'With its Sustainability Fund, Coop is therefore also investing in raising public awareness.', 'It wants to make consumers aware of the wide selection of products available to them, and also of the fact that their purchasing be haviour can have a positive impact.', 'For example, Coop is using tasting sessions in its sales outlets to bring to life choice mountain products from the ownlabel sustainability brand Pro Montagna and also Coop Naturaplan regional organic produce.', 'The Fund also finances Pro Specie Rara seedling mar kets to highlight the large variety of Swiss native va rieties and breeds.', 'Coop also uses its annual pres ence at the Natur sustainability

launch of the Coop ownlabel sustainability brand Naturaline in .', 'Via the Biore Foundation, Coop is also sup porting numerous local social projects such as the construction of schools and a mobile health clinic.', 'Coop is convinced that establishing longterm busi ness relationships and incorporating social projects into its core business are ultimately better ways of achieving a sustainable impact than simply making donations to institutions.', 'For example, the inhabit ants of Swiss mountain regions are benefiting more in the long term from a product label of their own such as the Coop ownlabel sustainability brand Pro Montagna than from receiving a oneoff cash dona tion.', 'Because all Pro Montagna products are both produced and processed in the Swiss mountains, the added value stays in the mountain regions, thereby safeguarding existing jobs and in many cas es creating new ones.', 'In addition, Coop makes a contribution to the nonprofit organization Coop Aid for Mountain Regions for each product sold.', 'And as Switzerlands largest supplier of Fairtrade Max Havelaar products, Coop is making a lasting contri bution to the people behind it all.', 'Thanks to the Fairtrade products sold by Coop in , around million francs were paid into Fairtrade premium projects, which local producers select and manage themselves.', 'Christmas donations to social organizations The four Christmas donations that Coop made in for the second time were exceptions to the “core business” rule and of course, at Christ mas exceptions are permitted.', 'With a total of francs, Coop supported not only the “Every centime counts” campaign but also the Pro Infirmis organization for disabled people, Reka holiday villages and over organizations that provide Christmas meals for the needy.', 'Promoting health Voluntary action in many areas The eating habits of children and adults are becom ing increasingly unhealthy, and many people are overweight.', 'Coop believes in taking voluntary action rather than resorting to a fat tax such as the one re cently introduced in Denmark.', 'When developing its product ranges, Coops efforts are centred on freshness, variety and optimized recipes.', 'As part of the ac tionsanté initiative launched by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health in , Coop has already voluntarily reduced the sugar and salt content and optimized the fat quality in a number of its ownla bel brand product groups.', 'For example, Coop Quali té Prix and Prix Garantie yoghurts now contain ap proximately % less sugar, and its fresh desserts contain around % less.', 'Coop has also committed to actionsanté that it will implement the target val ues defined for the optimum salt content of fresh convenience products by the end of .', 'The packaging of around Coop ownlabel brand products displays clear, comprehensive nutritional information in the form of a food profile.', 'Special products for vegetarians are labelled with the Euro pean

indicate a sufficient intake of fruit and vegetables.', 'Raising awareness and motivating In addition to the information displayed on prod ucts, Coop provides comprehensive nutritional in formation and services on the Internet, in the Coop member press and on numerous fact sheets.', 'The projects it supports include FitFuture an initiative to com bat lack of exercise and obesity in schoolchildren, and Gorilla, a national project that promotes healthy eating in children and young people.', 'To promote the health of its own employees, Coop has taken meas ures including the provision of courses on nutrition and exercise in its Logistics department.', 'For example, a joint initiative with “ a day” resulted in sales activities such as carrier bags full of fruit and vegetables in tended to specifically boost the consumption of seasonal produce.', 'Protecting young people Alcohol test purchases as a monitoring tool The pressure on retailers and the catering trade to effectively protect young people is as intense as ever.', 'In , Coop undertook to sell alcohol only to people over years of age.', 'For monitoring purposes, Coop either carries out test purchases itself or commissions others to do so.', 'These purchases are conducted in accordance with standardized criteria laid down in the Swiss Federal Office of Public Healths manual for test purchases.', 'For , Coop set itself the ambitious target of meeting the regulations for the protection of young people in % of all cases.', 'A Groupwide analysis showed large regional varia Society Coop Group Sustainability Report tions, but the overall success rate was %, and Coop therefore just met its target.', 'By setting the target for at %, Coop is underlining its clear intention to give young people an extremely high level of protection.', 'Age restrictions are displayed in large lettering both on the shelves and at checkouts.', 'There are significantly fewer contraventions of the regulations for the protection of young people in cantons where there is good monitoring.', 'Coop is opposed to pricerelated measures for protecting young people, such as minimum prices or even higher levels of duty on alcohol.', 'Other activities Donating food to the needy In Switzerland, it is estimated that one person in ten is living in poverty.', 'With the support of “Schweizer Tafel” Swiss table, “Tischlein deck dich” Table be set and Caritas, Coop is helping to combat poverty in Switzerland and is making sure that perfectly edible food does not have to be thrown away.', 'These two organizations collect
