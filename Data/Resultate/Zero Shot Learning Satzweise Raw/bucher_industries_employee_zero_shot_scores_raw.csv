related services, solutions and software.', 'A key Group focus is the use of smartification, electrification and digitalisation to provide customers with Bucher products that are more efficient, safer and more convenient to use.', 'Bucher Industries Customers Sustainability report division highlights Improving efficiency with robotics for livestock farmers Kuhn Group launched “AURA”, an autonomous feed loading and mixing solution that allows livestock farmers to reduce their labour expenses and focus their time on higher value added operational tasks.', '“AURA” manages the complete cycle of silage loading, mixing rations and precise distribution of the feed to the livestock multiple times a day.', 'Maintaining consistent feeding times and rations is beneficial for quality milk

electrification in see Environmental impact of products and services.', 'The division launched the “Husky Le”: a fully electric liquid brine sprayer, which uses a unique battery buffer system and can be mounted on both conventional and electric vehicles.', 'It is specifically designed for the “CityCat Ve”, which means that this new compact sweeper is not only fully electric, it can also be used multifunctionally throughout the year: in the winter as a brine sprayer and in the summer as a street sweeper.', 'Brine spraying offers the additional environmental advantage of using less salt while still melting snow more quickly than nondissolved salt.', 'Reducing emissions through innovative hydraulics solutions Bucher Hydraulics further developed the AX series of innovative pumps and motors which, due to their innovative construction principle, are especially well suited for electricpowered machinery.', 'The electrohydraulic subsystem is composed of a hydraulic cylinder, which is controlled by an electric motor in combination with the AX pump.', 'This decentralised linear drive solution permits continuous operation at the highest level of energy efficiency, meaning it produces hardly any waste heat.', 'Because of this, it has aroused interest among customers working on nextgeneration machines, which will need to reduce their CO emissions significantly to be compliant with upcoming legal requirements.', 'A further advantage is that “HELAX” can be easily integrated into a machine without any need for indepth hydraulics knowledge on the customers end.', 'Reducing the need for rinse water with awardwinning technology Bucher Vaslin launched the “AQUA PULSE” accessory, a semiautomatic system for rinsing grape press tanks.', 'The specially designed spraying head is automatically directed inside the press tank and uses a highpressure jet of cold water to clean the surfaces in a predefined washing sequence.', 'The new designs and processes used for “AQUA PULSE” reduce water consumption by at least % compared to traditional rinsing processes.', 'Reducing the impact of recalls through optimised product tracing The more precisely food producers can track raw materials from their origin to the final product destination, the lesser the impact of potential product recalls due to contamination or noncompliance.', 'Bucher Unipektin responded to this need of its customers and developed a new product tracing module for the “SCADA .” control system for the fruit juice industry.', 'The system closely tracks the journey of raw materials and production batches and provides the data to meet the most stringent requirements for product tracing as required by law and international trade standards.', 'This highly automated failsafe documentation feature saves the customer many working hours for manual data capture and helps limit the volume of recalled products.', 'Bucher Industries Customers Sustainability report Customer health and safety Bucher invests heavily in health and safety considerations when developing and manufacturing its products.', 'Protecting customers begins there and continues into training and support throughout the products lifespan.', 'Buchers divisions strictly observe the comprehensive legal requirements and standards that regulate their industries.', 'To ensure the continuously safe operation and maintenance of Bucher machinery, they routinely provide their customers with specialised safety trainings and support.', 'Today, the products security is as important to the company as their safety.', 'The safety of Buchers products is ensured through continuous interaction with customers and safety certifications such as RoHS, REACH and CE, as well as sectorspecific certifications.', 'There are also strict

functionality and userfriendliness.', 'Reducing the carbon footprint of a glass container through gob size control Furnaces for glass production must hold temperatures of around °C.', 'Reducing losses in the glass container manufacturing process can hence significantly lower emissions.', 'This can be achieved with Bucher Emhart Glass “GobRadar”, a closedloop control that uses a camerabased sensor to optically monitor the weight and shape of each individual gob during forming and automatically adjusts the feeder as required.', 'With more accurate gob weight control, the amount of glass per container can be reduced close to specified weight limits, lowering the carbon footprint of each container.', 'Assuming typical production conditions for gram glass containers at bottles per minute, a reduction of % weight variation would result in savings of tonnes of glass per year and a CO reduction of approximately tonnes annually for such a production line.', 'Additionally, more consistent gob weights reduce variations in the forming process, resulting in fewer container defects and decreased losses, further reducing the carbon footprint.', 'Bucher Industries Environment Sustainability report Minimising crop protection products needed in agriculture through precision spraying Bucher Landtechnik has entered into a strategic partnership with the company Ecorobotix.', 'The collaboration was launched with “ARA”, a tractormounted, highprecision sprayer that greatly reduces the use of herbicides in plane fields and row crops.', 'Using cuttingedge artificial intelligence,
