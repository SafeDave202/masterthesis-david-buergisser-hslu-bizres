public trans port.', 'From a sustainability point of view, they are therefore generally well positioned, as they are accessible by environmentallyfriendly mobility and do not contribute to urban sprawl.', 'Due to their central location, these properties also have a special importance in the cityscape and in revi talising the surrounding area.', 'With their spatial presence, our properties influence not only the immediate surroundings and the everyday life of tenants and neighbours, but also the perception of passersby.', 'For this reason, we attach great importance to architectural quality for new build ings and conversions, but also for major renova tions, which ultimately leads to an enhancement of the public space.', 'Sustainability report Ecological enhancement of the surroundings We endeavour to better exploit the potential for promoting biodiversity by ecologically enhancing the surroundings to our properties and where possible also terraces and roofs.', 'For example, a versatile roof terrace has been designed in the new ATMOS building, which can also be used as an outdoor workspace.', 'The small, treecovered oases on the extensively landscaped plaza will contribute to reducing heat islands.', 'In we intend to plan a pilot project in the area of environmental design focusing specifically on the improvement of biodiversity and expect to implement it in the following year.', 'Demand for sustainable mobility It is important to predict the mobility needs of us ers of offices and commercial premises, to take appropriate account of them within planning and strive for mobility that is as sustainable as possi ble.', 'More than % of the buildings in our portfolio are situated in areas falling within PT Public Trans port Class A, and are therefore very well con nected.', 'Participatory development and local commitment Local commitment also means that, when devel oping large areas or during major construction projects, we think about neighbourhood develop ment with the goal of finding solutions with all parties involved, leading to a sustainable use of the site from an ecological, social and economic point of view.', 'We want to create animated areas where people can meet, where they like to linger, and where local jobs are created.', 'We seek to develop solutions in as co operative a manner as possible that generate economic and social value over the long term and cause minimal damage to the environment.', 'We take account of the urban development objectives regarding the mix of uses, infrastructure and sus tainability for the respective areas and try to sup port them in the best possible way.', 'For instance, the new ATMOS building, which should comply with the Minergie PEco standard, will contribute to achieving a sustainable neighbour hood development with high construction quality and thus a highquality urban identity.', 'New outdoor spaces will significantly enhance the surround ings and will turn into welcome relaxation areas and meeting points for old and young.', 'Communication and interaction with local stake holders and neighbours is an essential element of our social commitment, within both construction projects as well as when operating properties.', 'That is why we conduct regular dialogue and infor mation events, especially in relation to newbuild projects.', 'Social performance

opentransportdata.swiss Generally speaking, requirements for bicycle parking, charging stations for electrical vehicles as well as cloakroom and shower facilities are incor porated into the planning of new buildings.', 'For example, a large bicycle parking unit has been in cluded within plans for the new ATMOS building.', 'In addition, there is a basic system with power rails for any further expansion of electric charging stations.', 'These criteria are also taken into account within renovation projects.', 'One initiative has been the creation of bicycle parking spaces and bicycle stands at Moosstrasse in Rüschlikon.', 'In , electrical charging stations were retro fitted also at Seebahnstrasse , at Förrlibuck strasse and at Hardturmstrasse in Zurich.', 'The basic system at the last two locations has been designed so that further charging sta tions can be connected at any time.', 'Sustainability report Rue du Marché Renovation of a historic building in the heart of Geneva In , PSP Swiss Property initiated the renovation of the historic «Maison Bonnet» building in the heart of Genevas Rues Basses.', 'The conversion from an office property into a hotel was a challenge.', 'The result of this complex conversion is a successful example of how high demands for modernity and digitalisation, strict require ments on the conservation side and energy efficiency goals can be reconciled.', 'Maison Bonnet was completely remodelled inside: Previously occupied by commercial and administrative space, the historic building was transformed into a hotel with modern rooms.', 'The hotel was opened in September .', 'This conversion has not only given new life to Maison Bonnet it also revital ises and enhances Genevas city centre.', 'Sustainability report Energetic refurbishment It was important to implement stateoftheart building technology to enable both the adaptation to tenant needs as well as compliance with historic pres ervation requirements.', 'Thanks to the renovation, energy consumption is halved despite more intensive use.', 'The GEAK classification of E for the building envelope or D for the over all energy efficiency could be raised to a B.', 'The

Richard Powers for citizenM hotels Sustainability report Tenants Satisfied tenants are the number one priority for the suc cess of a real estate company.', 'We like to have tenants who value our service and our buildings and can work pro ductively in them.', 'With our own property management and care takers, we aim to offer our tenants an optimal framework for successful business activities by having a customer focus and providing functional, flexible and attractive business premises.', 'When doing so we work as efficiently as possible so as to enable our tenants to benefit from low costs.', 'Thanks to our efforts in relation to energy efficien cy and reducing CO we have already been able for instance to save at least CHF million in ener gy costs and CO taxes for our tenants since .', 'Operational efficiency Operational efficiency in the management and maintenance of our properties reduces our costs and improves our internal communication as well as our engagement with tenants and business partners.', 'It also has positive effect on ancillary expenses.', 'As part of operational efficiency, we also want to keep the environmental impact as low as possi ble, especially in the areas of energy and water consumption as well as CO emissions.', 'An impor tant basis for this is the adequate measurement of consumption.', 'More than twothirds of our properties are now connected to our energy con trol and alarm management system.', 'This enables us to centrally monitor the relevant consumption values of our properties and see at a glance whether or not the current figures are within the tolerance range.', 'In the event of irregularities such as a conspicuous increase in water consumption, we can react immediately.', 'Permanent monitoring therefore also pays off economically for tenants as it reduces heating costs and CO emissions.', 'Optimisation of operations It is possible to reduce energy consumption sig nificantly through structural measures.', 'For us the optimisation of operations is directly related to the type of building and the applicable warranty conditions.', 'The focus here is on ensur ing operation and comfort to the satisfaction of the tenants.', 'The actual energy optimisation takes place afterwards.', 'Due to the everincreasing con nectivity of technical systems, the early detection and elimination of defects and software errors becomes increasingly important.', 'Essentially, all completed projects at PSP Swiss Property pass through this phase.', 'For larger and more complex buildings we involve various external specialists.', 'The first phase of operational optimisation has been completed on the Grosspeter Tower.', 'This has allowed us to gain experience for future pro jects in terms of the reciprocal dependence of technical systems on each other within such a complex system.', 'Sustainability report Energetic operational optimisation in existing buildings During operation, problems with comfort or sudden increases in energy consumption cannot be com pletely excluded.', 'Operational optimisation is currently being carried out on the Richtipark Wallisellen in conjunction with an exter nal partner following the identification of signifi cant further potential for reducing energy con sumption.', 'The optimisation mentioned last year on the Hürlimann development site is steadily providing relevant information for strategic deci sions in terms of future energy supply to the site, and has not yet been completed.', 'Energetic operational optimisation as a permanent task During the course of technical renovations, we equip the facilities with a building management system, if appropriate.', 'At a minimum, this includes the central energy control and alarm system, which enables central energy management and performance monitoring.', 'The focus is on efficient plant oper ation, which we ensure for the entire expected duration.', 'Depending on the use, the task of opti misation can also consist in preventing energy consumption from rising.', 'For example, following the achievement of significant energy improve ments over the last two years, we have moved the property at Hardturmstrasse on to this phase.', 'Environmental performance measures page : Electricity, district heating and cooling, fuels oilgas Environmental performance measures page : Greenhouse gas emissions Scope , and Environmental performance measures page : Energy intensity, Greenhouse gas intensity Water consumption and waste prevention The focus of our ecological efforts in relation to operational aspects clearly lies on reducing energy consumption and CO emissions.', 'However, other resources are consumed in addition to energy, such as for instance water, office materials or cleaning materials.', 'Furthermore, waste is pro duced.', 'We seek to make efforts as far as possible in order to minimise the negative effects of operations.', 'Structural measures: as a general rule, office buildings are not major consumers of water.', 'Watersaving valves and devices are installed in new and renovated buildings.', 'Specific water consumption was .', 'Last years consumption was significantly above average due to a renovation project at the thermal baths on the Hürlimann development site in Zurich, whereas the figure for the reporting year is slightly below the longterm

awareness concerning environmental protection amongst building users.', 'This applies in particular to water saving but also waste.', 'However, we endeavour to support our tenants in this area and to provide suitable infrastructure and access to services that enable and facilitate the avoidance of waste as well as reuse and recycling.', 'Environmental performance measures page : Water consumption Environmental performance measures page : Wasser intensity Sustainability report Service orientation and wellbeing of tenants For us, appreciation, reliability, quality and trans parency are the basis of a professional business relationship that is successful in the long term.', 'We want to be a solutionoriented, trustworthy and flexible partner for our customers and busi ness partners.', 'This step is followed by comprehensive support for fitout and occupation.', 'After that, it is the task of our property managers and local caretakers to identify new customer needs at an early stage, provide proactive support, and take the appropri ate measures.', 'Setting us apart from other com panies, we offer all these services inhouse.', 'Good communication is essential in order to iden tify the needs of tenants and also to raise their awareness concerning issues such as climate change.', 'The sustainability factor was always part of this process.', 'This makes sense for both parties but also for the environ ment as it helps to avoid expensive and energy intensive relocations.', 'The following issues will be addressed as a matter of priority in future: Increased digitalisation in marketing: supports this process through greater trans parency, efficiency and improved support in finding the ideal property.', 'Efficient and competent support: thanks to our own property management we are uniquely close to our tenants.', 'Green lease: we would like to raise our tenants awareness in relation to sustainability and make them more involved in our efforts, for example in relation to energy optimisation and water saving.', 'During the second half of the year we held discussions with a major tenant concerning a more formal documenta tion of both sides ambitions in the area of sustainability.', 'Since there are no official templates for green leases in Switzerland, we have drawn up our own green lease addendum to the lease.', 'Wellbeing of tenants Our tenants should feel at ease in our buildings so that they can carry out their business activities productively and successfully.', 'It is also important to guarantee safety and security.', 'The tenant survey carried out in the late autumn of showed that demand for hygiene meas ures has increased sharply as a result of the Corona virus crisis.', 'Needs such as greater air exchange or opening windows could in turn have detrimental effects in terms of energy efficiency requirements.', 'Sustainability report In order to enable us to focus more strongly on tenant needs, we have further enhanced our capacities in tenant fitout, and in October transferred them to our new Business Develop ment unit.', 'This enables us to take on board sustainability considerations, such as resource efficiency or wellbeing, health and safety, at an early stage into the planning of tenant fitout work.', 'For example, the team considers the optimal con figuration of the various areas within the office in order to enable the office to continue to be usable without restriction also during a pandemic.', 'We have tested our own offices for “Covidsuitability” and, in conjunction with an external service provid er, drawn up a socalled “health check” for offices and shops, which can also be offered to our ten ants where required.', 'It further highlights action that can be taken by the tenant in relation to behaviour, equipment and working time organisation Social performance measures page : HS impact assessments, and number of incidents Focus Issue: more detailed consideration of sustainability in the tenant survey In the autumn of we carried out a survey amongst the largest tenants, asking how satisfied they were with their tenancy in general but also specifically in relation to the property, caretaker and quality of support from property management.', 'Detailed questions were asked in relation to rental space needs, sustainability, digitalisation and future services.', 'Satisfaction increased compared to the survey.', 'In order to be able to better identify needs in rela tion to sustainability and to identify any interest in taking action, for the first time we incorporated a major block on this issue into this years tenant survey.', 'The survey identified a high level of inter est in sustainability topics.', 'Out of the tenants surveyed, % are already pur suing a specific sustainability strategy.', 'More than % view improved data exchange in a positive light and support the formal documentation of re ciprocal sustainability ambitions.', 'There is also a particular openness towards measures to ensure energy efficiency and the purchase of renewable electricity, although according to respondents a lot has already been done in these areas.', 'Moreover, a sustainable building concept is con sidered to be important or very important for two thirds of respondents.', 'It appears to be significant for more than one third for such buildings to be certified with a sustainable building label.', 'In addition, bicycle park ing spaces and charging stations for emobility are high up the list.', 'However, it is clearly apparent from the survey that enhanced coopera tion in relation to sustainability would be abso lutely welcomed.', 'Sustainability report GianMarco Hosang, PSP Swiss Property Project manager Business Development Tenant fitout “The Steinentorberg property
