damage Dear customers, suppliers and business partners, Dear colleagues, This Sustainability Report covers the financial years and two years which turned out to be fundamentally different for the entire world.', 'Looking back on that year, this is what I said: If we are to remain competitive by constantly coming up with new and desirable products, it will require continuous investment.', 'In order to be able to finance that investment, our focus must always be on maintaining our profitability.', 'To do anything else would be irresponsible.', 'Wars, breaches of human rights on an unimaginable scale, millions of young people in developing countries with no prospects, not to mention globalisation, have led to multi cultural societies around the world, including here in Switzerland.', 'It is impos sible to ignore the resulting social conflict and this is also having a farreaching impact on political voting patterns.', 'And theres no shortage of other social problems with a high potential for causing con flict: the everwidening gulf between rich and poor, gender inequality and increasingly worrying racism are just three examples.', 'Only by consistently keeping that in mind are we truly living up to our social responsibilities.', 'Confirmation that we as a company are performing very well when it comes to sustain ability and that we demonstrably intend to do even better has come in the form of a very special award: the international EcoVadis ratings platform has assessed over , companies around the world, including Girsberger.', 'The EcoVadis assessment criteria cover a wide range of objectives and measures, focusing on doing business in a socially and ecologically responsible way.', 'By winning a gold medal, the Girsberger Group is in the top % for the overall assessment of corporate responsibility, in the top % for its environmental measures and the top % for sustainable procurement, out of all the companies in the furnituremaking sector all over the world that have been certified by EcoVadis.', 'EcoVadis SAS Paris, France https:ecovadis.comen We regard this award, and our remarkable achievement in being one of the few industrial companies to have made their production climateneutral ever since , as an incen tive to continue our sustainability endeavours with even greater resolution… This extract from the text of my speech at that time shows just how unsuspecting we still were at the end of .', '“At Girsberger, we see ourselves as being under an ongoing obli gation to ensure that the continuing threat to the environ ment and the need to do business sustainably are perma nently rooted in our conscious ness.” All of a sudden, in spring , everyones focus was solely and exclusively on the social and economic consequences of the pandemic.', 'Greta Thunberg, the Fridays For Future cam paign, climate activists and all the frequent demonstrations, events and media reports about climate change were swept away by the coronavirus pandemic.', 'All the efforts that were being made in relation to the environment and sustainability and were previously so important suddenly became mean ingless, all over the world.', 'firm priority for every company.', 'In order to make judgments and decisions and manage our business in a way which takes account of both economic and ecological factors at all times, we need to go beyond the requirements of an environmental management system.', 'That is why setting environmental goals and monitoring whether we are fulfilling them must be integral parts of our business planning and also of our internal reporting and control systems.', 'This applies to all our production sites in Switzerland, Germany, Serbia and Turkey, and our branches in other countries, as well as to Mobimex AG based in Seon, Switzerland.', 'We are constantly setting ourselves new and binding goals and we work consistently to achieve them.', 'After all, we are very aware that, unless businesses take the initiative voluntarily, climate change cannot be stopped.', 'The real challenge is how to ensure that thinking and acting in the right way, for the good of both the economy and the environment, is firmly rooted in peoples minds.', 'What is certain is that we will continue to double down on our efforts to protect the environment and continuously improve our sustainable approach to doing business.', 'We thank you for your attention and your loyalty to Girsberger.', 'At Girsberger, we see ourselves as being under an ongoing obligation to ensure that the continuing threat to the environment and the need to do business sustainably are permanently rooted in our consciousness.', 'Thats because our planet continues to face ecnomic, social and environmental challenges which can only be overcome with im mense effort.', 'In an attempt to address the acute global deficiencies more effectively, in the United Nations set out a political blueprint for the period up to in the form of its Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs for short.', 'Agenda represents a commit ment that over countries have signed up to, including Switzerland and Germany.', 'The goals set out guidelines for a more sustainable world.', 'The aim is to establish a basis for making global economic progress while ensuring social justice and not overstepping the Earths environmental limits.', 'The SDGs cover a wide range of aspects of sustain ability such as poverty, health, climate change and environmental damage which are particularly relevant to businesses, enabling them to align their strategies with the global objectives.', 'The private sector has a crucially important role to play in making sure that the sustain ability goals of Agenda are met.', 'Thats because, in a free market economy, the main responsibility for all matters of sustainability falls to companies businesses.', 'Every single company is called upon to make a real and effective contribution within its core business as part of the progress on sustainability that absolutely must be made.', 'In the light of that, our sustainability strategy that I outlined in our last report remains as pressing as ever: protecting the environment as effectively as possible should be a Integrating the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for In , the United Nations set out a political blueprint for action by

of price and quality, the risks relating to environmental and social issues are limited thanks to the legal framework, as are any indirect environmental costs, while the risk of injury at work and breaches of human rights is kept to a minimum.', 'In , the European Union made it a legal requirement under the CSR Directive EU for companies to meet their social obligations and make a positive

and raw materials Economy At Girsberger, we look at the full life cycle of a piece of furniture from the procurement of the materials right through to its disposal.', 'The aim is for the least possible burden to be placed on people and the environment at every stage.', 'We therefore choose materials that are produced in an ecofriendly way and can be disposed of in their pure form, and we avoid those with poor ecological properties, such as PVC, heavy metals or azo dyes.', 'Metal All steel products that we use or process, such as tubes and steel sheet, contain a high proportion of recycled metal.', 'At the end of its product lifespan, steel is fully reused as steel scrap for new alloys.', 'Wherever possible, surfaces are finished without chromium .', 'We use aluminium almost exclusively in the form of diecast aluminium parts which, if the component size permits, are marked with the relevant material identification code.', 'Aluminium alloys are very strong, have good casting properties and can be finished in many different ways.', 'It is also a material that can be recycled practically ad infinitum.', 'A large proportion of the aluminium used in manufacturing today has been in circulation for decades.', 'Depending on the particular application, we also use fibrereinforced plastics for some components.', 'We use CFCfree steamfoamed polyurethane foam for foam padding.', 'We mark every plastic part with an identification code so that parts can be identified and sorted into the different types of material at the time of disposal in order to facilitate recycling.', 'A certain proportion of recycled material is always used in suitable components.', 'However, for quality and safety reasons it is not always possible to use recycled plastics.', 'Seat cover materials Our seat cover fabrics satisfy OekoTex Standard or the EU Ecolabel criteria.', 'Together with the whole product, they are checked against the EUs list of banned emissions and chemicals as part of annual compliance audits for the “Tested for harmful substances TÜV Rheinland Certified” certification.', 'The durable highquality cover materials we offer may be made of wool, synthetic fibres, or a mix of natural and synthetic fibres.', 'Seat covers made of synthetic materials can be recycled after use.', 'The cutting department in Endingen monitors waste volumes continuously.', 'The textile cutting on our modern upholstery cutter is optimised and nested via the control station nesting of the cut parts and thus enables us to minimise waste upholstery material by just under %.', 'This measure will enable us to further reduce waste volumes in the coming reporting period.', 'Our leather is processed exclusively in tanneries certified to ISO .', 'Waste volumes are continually monitored and optimized.', 'Small leather offcuts are recycled by the shoe and handbag industries.', 'Paper Our total paper consumption has been reduced by over % in the latest reporting period.', 'Measures such as switching to duplex printing as the standard setting and digitising certain processes such as archiving, using a document management system DMS, have all contributed to reducing the use of paper.', 'During the next reporting period we aim to try switching to using recycled paper in our administration department.', 'We will also continue to raise awareness among our staff of the need to reduce paper consumption, by inter nal information campaigns and talking to them about it directly at our bimonthly “notice board” meetings.', 'Water Over % of our water consumption is at the Bützberg site.', 'This is due partly to the com pany Galtec AG, which has been renting plant since , and partly to wooddrying processes and irrigation systems, use of which varies depending on our operations and the weather respectively.', 'Our reduced use of the wooddrying equipment due to the corona virus pandemic resulted in a fall of .', '% in our water consumption in compared with .', 'It also enables us to avoid procurement processes that may have damaging environmental consequences.', 'Our very special business depends on three cornerstones: the fascination of wood and our maxim: “Beautiful solid wood from sustainable forests” our specialist expertise and our close connections with our trusted wood suppliers in Europe.', 'We intend to continue to nurture and consolidate these vitally important values for the good of our customers.', 'Peter Reichen Head of Wood Trading, Girsberger AG Country of origin approximate percentages Europe Switzerland,

wood we used m of a total m.', 'Black walnut also continues to be very important, accounting for .', '% m and European walnut at .', '% of our total usage.', 'The market continues to demand characterful, preferably dark woods with a strong grain pattern ringporous.', 'So it is no wonder that practically all the ringporous woods such as oak, black walnut, elm and European walnut have been widely used and very popular for some time.', 'We are, therefore, making good use of our local ringporous timbers.', 'Sustainable forest management is a high priority for us.', 'In that respect, the various ecocertificates and labels currently in use do not offer us enough security.', 'Thats why it is all the more important for us to know exactly where our solid wood comes from.', 'In order to guarantee that our solid wood comes from sustainable forests, our specialist experts at Girsberger inspect it at sites across Europe before buying.', 'However, that expense is worth it, because it means we can follow the trees on their journey right through from the log to the finished end product: from the very start, be that actually in the forest or in the clearings where the tree trunks are collected up, through the work at the sawmill, processing in the steam chamber and storage in the open air, sometimes for years followed by kiln drying.', 'Con sequently, we are in control at all times of where the tree trunks have come from and how they are matured, right through to becoming a usable raw product.', 'As we have built up our wood trading business, which since has been a separate business unit, our own need for solid wood has come to be of secondary importance.', 'We currently have stocks of about cubic metres of air and kilndried wood available at our storage sites in Switzerland, Germany, France and Austria, ready for our woodprocess ing customers to make their choice.', 'The challenge over the coming years will continue to be how to accurately estimate our requirement for timbers of all kinds.', 'Oak in particular has to be stored for a very long time before it can be processed in a way that meets our high quality standards.', 'The period between cutting the logs and processing is never less than three to five years depending on the thickness of the boards.', 'We have to consider now what quality, thickness and finish might be required for oak in three to five years time.', 'When buying timber, making the right, wellplanned and forwardlooking decisions today has an impact not only on com mercial success and optimum availability but also on our ecological footprint.', 'The more finely tuned our stocks, the more prudent we can be in our use of the valuable raw material Peter Reichen Head of Wood Trading, Girsberger AG Economy Operational waste, disposal Bützberg site Wood waste remained stable during the reporting period, accounting for % of total waste.', 'This wood waste meets more than % of the heating energy requirement for the entire Bützberg site.', 'Nonreusable waste reached a peak in due to a remanufacturing project.', 'We refur bished the theatre seats for one of our customers and fitted them with new seat pads.', 'We disposed of the resulting old seat pads approximately tons correctly via an authorised recycling partner.', 'We had no similar projects in and the volume of nonrecyclable waste fell back to the level of earlier years.', 'In terms of recyclable waste, we were able to put a stop to the steady increase in card board waste by optimising packaging, in partnership with our subsidiary Boreal.', 'The volume of waste in was more or less the same as before deliveries from Boreal began.', 'During this reporting period, the ban on importing plastic waste that was imposed by a number of Asian countries, primarily China, meant that the market for this kind of waste collapsed.', 'We are in talks with our disposal company about going back to categorising plastic film as a separate item.', 'We aim to keep the proportion of reusable waste up to at least % over the course of the next reporting period.', 'Endingen site Waste wood, primarily in the form of oneway pallets and transport fixings, has been recycled into chipboard since .', 'Singleuse wooden trestles have been replaced by steel trestles for transporting leather.', 'These now shuttle between Endingen and our leather suppliers.', 'Our waste management concept has enabled us to stabilise the proportion of recyclable waste such as cardboard, paper, glass, electrical items, metal, film, leather offcuts, wood, and polystyrene waste at over %.', 'We intend to maintain at least this level in the next reporting period.', 'Fabric remnants still have to be incinerated as there appears to be no economically viable and ecofriendly recycling solution at present.', 'Logistics Road traffic, transport and packaging Economy Road traffic and transport in Switzerland During we will be replacing our oldest lorries still Euro .', 'Then all our lorries will comply with the current Euro emissions regulations.', 'We anticipate that this will also enable us to reduce our fuel consumption per kilometre a little more.', 'For this report ing period, we had set ourselves the goal of reducing the number of kilometres driven when delivering our products to a minimum.', 'Naturally, we try to plan our routes even more efficiently, but it has become apparent that no further big improvements can be made.', 'Its a question of finding a compromise between meeting customer expectations and planning the best route.', 'Lorries account for about % of fuel consumption at the Bützberg site % in , % in .', 'That is to say, over twothirds of the fuel consumption is due to the cars used by our sales force, senior managers and service and installation technicians.', 'We want to try to reduce that proportion and in future switch to electric vehicles where it makes sense and is feasible.', '“Twothirds of the fuel consumption is by cars and trucks.', 'Here we want to try to switch to electric vehicles where it makes sense and is feasible.” Transport in other markets Outside Switzerland, our products are delivered by specialist furniture removal companies.', 'We intend to retain this system for the time being.', 'Packaging During this reporting period we have revised the packaging system at our subsidiary com pany, Boreal.', 'Our aim was to use less packaging material and to avoid plastic.', 'To a certain extent we have been able to improve the situation by using environmentallyfriendly and singletype materials such as cardboard packaging.', 'Often, sustainable packaging materials are not suitable for our purposes, too expensive or simply not available to Boreal in Serbia.', 'Roland
