'furthermore, the groups investments in operational development and strengthening of its market position contribute to job creation and are also an example of social responsibility.', 'this is a fully

that reason, partnering with subcontractors to reduce emissions is of special importance to DSV in terms of protecting the environment and climate.', 'Effective transportation is a crucial prerequisite for an ef ficient and highgrowth society.', 'Historically DSV has grown both through organic growth and through acquisitions and intends to continue to develop its business.', 'Increased operations entail an increase in the energy consumption of our suppliers which perform the physi cal transportation of cargo.', 'Despite the fact that the means of transportation be come more fuel efficient for every new generation, we must focus on improving the sustainability of the existing stock of vehicles on the basis of current technology.', 'First of all, this can be achieved through more fuel efficient driv ing, intermodal transportation solutions and use of biofuels.', 'However, these initiatives have little significant effect on carbon dioxide emissions here and now.', 'With the aim to promote a positive development DSV has set a number of targets for the internal processes at DSV and targets aimed at the suppliers providing transport services for the Group.', 'reduced Co emissions through more efficient transport solutions As a general objective, DSV must reduce the carbon emis sions of suppliers and own operations.', 'Therefore DSV has set a concrete target of a % improvement of the energy efficiency of all transport activities by compared to figures.', 'This means that DSV must continue to work with the suppliers to improve fuel efficiency and that DSV must continue its efforts to optimise capacity utilisation per unit.', 'An optimum utilisation of the space available on the indi vidual means of transportation will benefit the environment and can be achieved, e.g., by ensuring a good and effective planning of the cargo volumes available in the business net work.', 'The transport market is still highly fragmented and characterised by many small and mediumsized transport providers.', 'Ranking among the top players in the market, DSV has an extensive network and thus a good basis for maximising capacity utilisation.', 'DSV Spain has reduced its carbon emissions by sev eral tonnes in just one quarter by shifting freight from road to rail.', 'after the hour and kilometre train ride, the cargo is reloaded onto trucks again and carried to the customers.', 'the customers of DSV Spain are showing a great interest in rail transport and DSV Spain aims to offer more rail transport so lutions in future to the extent possible considering the potential of the existing railway network.', 'Global air and sea freight providers increasingly energy efficient The air and sea transport providers used by DSV are typi cally regional and global companies, which each focus on optimising operations.', 'Both types of suppliers make efforts to minimise fuel consumption, e.g.', 'by means of optimised route planning, adaptation of speed relative to distance and change of equipment.', 'These measures are reflected in an improved overall energy efficiency among the subcontractors of DSV.', 'Thus, the overall energy efficiency measured in carbon emissions per consignment improved by % for DSVs air transport activities and % for the shipping activities compared to .', 'Compared to , which is the basis for the target of a % reduction, we are also on track to deliver on the objective.', 'For air freight, the overall energy efficiency im proved by more than % and for sea freight by more than %.', 'a fragmented road freight market In , DSV Road operated in a fragmented and highly competitive market with focus on domestic transports, typically resulting in many departures and short distances.', 'In addition, the overall fuel consumption of the trucks used by DSV own and suppliers dropped by .% on average.', 'This is a result of several factors, including weather con ditions, driving style, traffic density and route planning.', 'The DSV corporate Social reSponSibility report enVironment anD climate energy efficiency of the Road Division dropped by almost % compared to , but has improved by more than % compared to .', 'The Road Division aims to change this by focusing on multimodal transport solutions, offer ing more ecofriendly products and working together with customers to switch to night distribution due to far better road passability.', 'progress through collaboration and measurement DSV partners with several customers to reduce the emis sions from transport operations.', 'A specific calculation of transport emissions based on key figures from DSVs suppliers and actual cargo volumes carried for the customers is used in assessing the emission reduction potential of the transport operations.', 'Improve ments can be obtained through better planning of ship ments, use of intermodal transportation, etc.', 'Green freight europe As a step towards expanding our cooperation with the cus tomers, DSV joined the Green Freight Europe programme in .', 'The organisation is a newly established independ ent joint programme for enterprises and transport opera tors to promote knowledge sharing and implementation of sustainability improvements and to track improvements by providing a common platform for collecting, analysing and monitoring carbon emissions from European road freight operations.', 'Green Freight Europe already has a long list of members among both large and small European manufac turers and transport operators, and DSV expects that it will soon become the leading independent voluntary pro gramme for reporting and improving environmental perfor mance of road freight transport in Europe.', 'euro standard targets for dsV road Management has set a target for the Road Divisions use of trucks that meet the highest emission standard applicable.', 'This target has been set to assure that we make optimum use of the newest technology.', 'According to the target set, at least % of the trucks used by the Road Division own and subcontractors trucks must have Euro engines by the end of .', 'We are pleased to note that this target was met already in as % of all trucks used by DSV satisfied the standard.', 'massive reduction in emissions of harmful substances The current EU requirements on truck exhaust emissions will soon be replaced by a new Euro standard, which in troduces stricter limits on the emissions of pollutants and harmful substances from trucks.', 'As from , all new trucks must satisfy this standard.', 'Emissions of the toxic substance nitrogen oxide NOx from a

DSV Management has also established internal targets for improving the energy efficiency of the Groups buildings and introduction of waste sorting procedures at DSV loca tions.', 'The energy saved in the operation of own buildings means lower emissions, and Management has adopted a target according to which % of all DSV companies must have carried out energy efficiency analyses of their build ings and implemented any relevant energy saving measures by .', 'Other steps have also been taken to reduce energy con sumption at the DSV locations, and which initiatives are the most effective varies greatly among the local companies.', 'However, central management of heat ing, air conditioning, ventilation and lighting contribute to reducing the total energy consumption at all locations.', 'As a result of the implemented measures, emissions from the operation of DSVs locations have been reduced for the second year running and by just over % compared to .', 'The consolidation of locations in different companies and countries is an ongoing process and, when deemed necessary, new facilities are built which can often accom modate several activities at the same location.', 'Some of the advantages of constructing new buildings is that it is pos sible to optimise the operation of the building according to the companies business activities and optimise the facilitys energy efficiency already at the construction stage.', 'Global recycling target Another internal target states that % of all DSV locations must have implemented waste collection procedures for the recycling of paper, plastic and cardboard by the end of .', 'It is difficult to measure the positive effect of waste re cycling measures on emissions, but the recycling of waste does contribute to reducing the consumption of resources.', 'DSV is close to achieving this target as almost % of all DSV locations have implemented procedures for collecting recyclable materials like paper, cardboards and plastic.', 'Con tinued efforts are made to meet the target in .', 'DSV corporate Social reSponSibility report enVironment anD climate business ethics and anticorruption in , dsV has worked on raising
