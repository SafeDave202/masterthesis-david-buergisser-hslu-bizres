significant positive impact in terms of supporting sustainability and strengthening resilience, especially through our core re insurance business solutions: • Mitigating climate risk and advancing the energy transition The effects of climate change and global warming are already evident and shaking up our risk landscape, eg through warmer average temperatures, rising sea levels, longer and more frequent heatwaves and more weather extremes.', 'We continue to evolve our way of doing business towards a lowcarbon economy in line with our netzero commitments and the Paris Agreement.', '• Building societal resilience Technological and economic development, population growth, ageing populations and other societal trends are putting people and assets in jeopardy.', 'With our reinsurance solutions and investments we help reduce societal vulnerabilities.', 'With our digital solutions we increase access to, and the availability and affordability of, reinsurance and risk knowledge worldwide, thus helping to close the protection gap.', 'To guide practical implementation of the strategy, we have defined the following three Principles: • Embed sustainability in all our business activities: We systematically consider ESG factors in all activities, ensure that sustainability is appropriately reflected in all roles and responsibilities and shift our existing business portfolio to make it more sustainable.', '• Lead sustainabilitylinked solutions and embrace opportunities: We shape sustainabilitylinked innovations and advance the transition to more sustainable products and services.', '• Quantify sustainability performance and impact: We set sustainability metrics and targets across the Group.', 'This contributes to a systematic capital allocation to risk pools with longterm value, aligns us with external frameworks such as the Paris Agreement and allows us to measure our contributions to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.', 'Our Sustainability Ambitions See website Swiss Re

protection against some of these risks.', 'Resilience and sustainability: the link Making the world more resilient is Swiss Res vision.', 'Sustainability as a strategic priority supports our ability to meet this vision.', 'Effective reinsurance protection plays a vital role in strengthening this ability.', 'Sustainability denotes the principle of achieving economic and social development that can be maintained in the long term, ie without overusing precious resources.', 'Major challenges that undermine sustainable development, eg climate change, insecure food supplies, health funding gaps, ageing infrastructure, etc, can weaken resilience because they create new risks or aggravate existing ones, further widening the protection gap.', 'Our focus on sustainability seeks to identify and address the challenges that threaten stable longterm development.', 'From the perspective of a reinsurer this translates into offering protection against such risks where viable, and supporting efforts to reduce them and to prevent them “adaptation” and “mitigation”.', 'This in turn helps strengthen resilience.', 'Finally, companies that make sustainability a priority across all aspects of their businesses are better qualified to adjust to the changing risk landscape they become more sustainable themselves.', 'In Swiss Res own case, this enhances our longterm prospects of continuing to meet our vision of making the world more resilient.', 'Swiss Re Sustainability Report For specific targets related to these objectives, take a look at the “Mitigating climate risk and advancing the

As part of implementing our Group Sustainability Strategy, we have developed a specific Climate Action Plan, which also serves as our climate strategy.', 'Swiss Re first detected the potential longterm challenges posed by climate change some years ago.', 'Consequently, it has become our most important sustainability issue: For a reinsurer, climate change constitutes a key topic because it leads to an increase in the severity and a change in the patterns of natural catastrophes such as windstorms, floods, excessive rainfall, heatwaves and drought.', 'In combination with growing asset concentrations in exposed areas and more widespread insurance protection, this will cause a rise in average losses.', 'Climate change is an essential element in our Group Sustainability Strategy: “Mitigating climate risk and advancing the energy transition” is one of our three overarching Sustainability Ambitions.', 'In the course of defining metrics and setting targets, we have developed our Climate Action Plan.', 'The plan builds on our commitments and initiatives of recent years, and combines three objectives: .', 'We aim to become the leading reinsurance company on physical climate risk. . We aim to become a leading provider of reinsurance solutions for lowcarbon transition opportunities. . We build partnerships to develop scalable solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change.', 'Swiss Re Sustainability Report How we determine materiality A key question for any company that seeks to advance sustainability is what this means in the context of its own business and industry: Which topics are “material” to achieving this goal?', 'In order to identify these material Sustainability Topics, we follow a structured process that taps into our internal risk expertise and inputs from ongoing dialogue with our stakeholders, and takes into account the work of various standard setters eg

services that are vital to societal and economic wellbeing, but are in serious decline in many places around the world.', 'Biodiversity as an emerging Sustainability Topic The importance of biodiversity Countries around the world depend on a range of vital natural services known as biodiversity and ecosystem services BES to help maintain the health and stability of their communities and economies.', 'These include, for example, water provision, food security and the regulation of air quality.', 'In fact, % of global GDP is dependent on intact ecosystems.', 'However, a recent study published by Swiss Re Institute revealed a serious decline in biodiversity and ecosystem services, affecting both developing and advanced economies.', 'As reinsurers, understanding the extent and impact of this decline and the associated risks is key to minimising further damage.', 'For example, trees protect coastal areas and riversides from erosion.', 'Conversely, measures to preserve biodiversity, such as reforestation, reduce the risk of damage from natural catastrophes at a lower cost than the financial losses caused by storms or flooding.', 'Preserving our natural assets also enhances our quality of life and provides revenue streams that should be protected.', 'Preserving ecosystems is therefore critical to preventing pandemics.', 'The Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Index One thing is clear maintaining a healthy balance between humans and nature will remain a key issue going forward.', 'For this reason, Swiss Re has developed the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services BES Index, which identifies the economic sectors and countries most exposed to biodiversity end ecosystem decline.', 'The index enables businesses and governments to factor biodiversity into their economic decisions.', 'The index also allows reinsurers to incorporate BES data into their risk assessment, thus helping to preserve BES, which are vital to societies resilience.', 'Naturebased
