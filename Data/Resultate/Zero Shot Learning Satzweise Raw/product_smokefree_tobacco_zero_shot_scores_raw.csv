Executive Officer To all our stakeholders, PMI manufactures nicotine containing products that are made of, or derived from, tobacco.', 'Although the vast majority of our sales is still in combustible products, mainly cigarettes, we are seeking to completely replace these by noncombustible, smoke free products, which are a better alternative for the health of those consumers who would otherwise continue smoking.', 'Since we announced our vision to deliver a smokefree future in , our annual combustible product shipment volume declined by billion units.', 'Almost half of this decline can be attributed to our own efforts, complementing government measures to prevent smoking initiation and encourage cessation, as we actively and purposefully switched many smokers who would otherwise have continued smoking cigarettes to our smokefree alternatives.', 'The increase in our smokefree product shipment volume by billion units over the same time period is a testament to this massive business transformation.', 'The business case for our strategy is clear: We were able to gain overall market share in the nicotinecontaining products market and deliver strong financial results in .', 'We generated an adjusted operating income of USD .', 'percent on a currencyneutral likefor like basis versus the prior year.', 'This was driven by growth in smokefree product users and sales volume, price increases of combustible products, coupled with the favorable impact of our cost saving initiatives and increasing leverage of existing smokefree product infrastructure.', 'Sustainability strategy is corporate strategy, and ESG issues are business issues.', 'We also improved our performance in a number of environmental, social, and governance ESG related areas, while strengthening our sustainability strategy, and setting new and ambitious targets for our most material sustainability topics.', 'For example, PMI continues to demonstrate leadership in addressing climate change.', 'We ranked on CDPs A Lists for climate and water security, achieved A for forest disclosure, and featured on CDPs Supplier Engagement Leaderboard once more.', 'We have set the target to become carbon neutral as a company by , and by including the whole value chain.', 'We also aim to reduce our absolute emissions consistent with a .degree global warming scenario.', 'Another ambitious and new environmental target relates to plastic and postconsumer waste, specifically the litter caused by cigarette butts.', 'We have developed and are implementing comprehensive plans to achieve a percent reduction of the plastic litter from our products by .', 'Regarding social impact, I would like to highlight the importance we place on guarding against youth initiation and youth use of nicotinecontaining products.', 'All of our markets have been tasked to further enforce and modernize youth access prevention programs.', 'I recognize that we still need to make meaningful progress with regard to diversity, equality, and inclusion.', 'These are all important developments, but it is equally clear to all of us at PMI that the biggest positive impact our company can have on society is to replace cigarettes with less harmful alternatives.', 'This is at the very core of our corporate strategy and sits atop our sustainability priorities.', 'I am convinced that it is possible to completely end cigarette sales in many countries within to years, but for that to happen, manufacturers and governments need to work in the same direction.', 'It reaffirms that we are disrupting our business from the inside, leading the industry toward a future without cigarettes, while meeting the needs of our stakeholders, and ensuring the longterm viability of our company.', 'Clarity of purpose is essential for internal alignment; change is tough for well established companies like ours, with strong business performance over decades.', 'It is natural for employees to continue the behaviors that have led to strong results.', 'It is equally clear to all of us at PMI that the biggest positive impact our company can have on society is to replace cigarettes with less harmful alternatives.', 'This is at the very core of our corporate strategy and sits atop our sustainability priorities.', 'Since the launch of our smokefree product IQOS, we have made enormous progress in terms of organizational capabilities, know how, the integration of sustainability in the way we operate, and in our business results.', 'To accelerate our progress, we must further enhance our ability to stay at the forefront of consumer centricity, technology, science, and innovation to build on PMIs unique scientific capabilities and outline the companys strategy for new products and services that go beyond tobacco and nicotine.', 'We continue to deal with skeptical stakeholders: international organizations, NGOs, media, and academics, who doubt that harm reduction through smokefree alternatives is sound public health policy or argue that our purposedriven strategy is nothing more than window dressing.', 'Harm reduction is an accepted approach in many areas of life: from reducing salt and sugar contents in food and drinks to lowering carbon emissions by switching to electric cars.', 'The alternatives are rarely without health risk or environmental impact, but product improvements are always welcomed when they are scientifically substantiated.', 'Sustainability strategy is corporate strategy, and ESG issues are business issues.', 'I cordially invite you to respond, challenge, and most of all, work with us as we remain focused on making our business one with a sustainable purpose.', 'André Calantzopoulos Chief Executive Officer PMIs Statement of Purpose While Philip Morris International Inc. PMI is widely known as a cigarette company, in it announced its new purpose: to deliver a smokefree future by focusing its resources on developing, scientifically substantiating and responsibly commercializing smokefree products that are less harmful than smoking, with the aim of completely replacing cigarettes as soon as possible.', 'These innovative alternative products do not burn tobacco, do not create cigarette smoke and therefore generate significantly lower levels of carcinogens and other toxic substances compared to cigarettes.', 'PMI believes that with the right regulatory encouragement and support from civil society, cigarette sales can end within to years in many countries.', 'The Company needs to continue earning the trust and active cooperation of a host of stakeholders, from its supply chain partners to regulators and public health authorities.', 'A smokefree future is attainable, and the benefits it can bring to the people who would otherwise continue to smoke, and hence to global public health, are enormous.', 'However, the Company cannot succeed alone.', 'Together with governments and civil society we can maximize this opportunity through a consensus that smokefree alternatives, when subject to proper government oversight and regulation, are part of a sound tobacco policy.', 'For decades, tobacco control has focused on strict fiscal, marketing and other measures to deter initiation and to encourage cessation.', 'These must be continued.', 'Nevertheless, while smoking prevalence rates continue to slowly decline, the World Health Organization projects that the estimated number of .', 'billion people who smoke tobacco products today will remain largely unchanged by , reflecting population growth.', 'Eliminating combustion from nicotine containing products is the way to significantly reduce their toxicity.', 'Thanks to rapid advances in science and technology, and strong PMI commitment, these products are now a reality.', 'Currently, PMIs smokefree portfolio comprises platforms that heat tobacco, vaporize nicotinecontaining liquids or essentially contain only nicotine, all without combustion.', 'Their development and manufacturing follow high standards of quality and consistency.', 'The scientific evaluation to substantiate their harm reduction potential compared to cigarette smoking is based on rigorous preclinical and clinical assessments and sophisticated systems toxicology.', 'The totality of the scientific evidence makes the Company confident that switching completely to these products is likely to present less risk of harm than continuing to smoke.', 'Postmarket surveillance is necessary to continue building this confidence, and, over time, quantify the reduction in morbidity and mortality through epidemiology.', 'For those who use nicotine in any form it is best to quit completely.', 'The Company must market them responsibly, so as to minimize any unintended use, while maximizing the switching of adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking.', 'This confirmed that the Company had the products and the science to fulfill its ambition to completely replace cigarettes.', 'In , with the full support of the Board of Directors, the Company announced its new purpose of delivering a smokefree future.', 'Since then the Company has fully aligned its employees with this purpose, and swiftly shifted its organizational focus and resources to smokefree alternatives.', 'Philip Morris International ESG Highlights While cigarette sales today remain the largest part of PMIs business in most countries, this is changing rapidly.', 'percent of PMIs global revenue, percent of its commercial expense and percent of its RD expenditure.', 'As of December , , of the approximately million people who regularly use the Companys products, approximately million already use IQOS, of whom .', 'million have stopped smoking and switched to this product.', 'The Company is actively accelerating the decline of cigarette smoking beyond what can be achieved by traditional tobacco control measures alone.', 'Going forward, the Company is committed to providing less harmful alternatives to the hundreds of millions of adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke, percent of whom PMI estimates are looking for better alternatives.', 'The Company will do so through a

'Nevertheless, for adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke, we believe that product innovation has a significant potential to benefit public health.', 'First, we are developing a product portfolio of smokefree products with a significantly reduced health impact compared to combustible cigarettes.', 'The reduced risk profile of these products is scientifically substantiated, following a stepbystep program derived from practices of the pharmaceutical industry.', 'Second, to reduce harm at the individual and population level, smokers must be interested in switching to smokefree products, rather than continuing to smoke cigarettes.', 'Here we need to innovate, transform our internal organization, and engage with legislators and regulators to ensure that people who would otherwise continue to smoke have access to smokefree alternatives.', 'PMI launches Heatbar in Switzerland and Australia.', 'The U.K.s Royal College of Physicians publishes a report on tobacco harm

of IQOS, no combustion occurs, and the aerosol generated has on average percent lower levels of HPHCs than found in reference cigarette smoke.', 'In our smokefree tobacco products, we are able to precisely control temperatures so that they release nicotine and flavors but do not reach the temperature necessary for combustion to occur.', 'By avoiding combustion, we reduce or eliminate the

containing nicotine should not be used by pregnant women, women who are breastfeeding, young people, or those suffering from cardiovascular diseases.', 'On the other hand, while the best option for adult smokers is to quit altogether, nicotine can support public health by encouraging adult smokers who would not otherwise quit to switch to smokefree products.', 'The Royal College of Physicians has said: “Nicotine is not, however, in itself a highly hazardous drug … it is inherently unlikely that nicotine inhalation itself contributes significantly to the mortality or morbidity caused by

labor through targeted initiatives and by developing strong working relationship with farmers, suppliers, civil society, governments, industry, and other stakeholders.', 'Contributing to alleviating poverty We have designed a number of initiatives to support contracted farmers in improving their income levels and thus the livelihoods of their households.', 'The initiatives offer a clear route to resolving labor abuses, particularly child labor, and include farming efficiency programs, improved mechanization and irrigation, crop diversification, and alternative business models.', 'Agricultural Labor Practices We use a riskbased approach to identify, prevent, and mitigate human rights—and labor rightsrelated incidents in PMIs tobacco supply chain.', 'Across the countries we source tobacco from, the most recurrent and difficult problems we aim to address include: • Work performed by children; • Inadequate and unsafe accommodation for farmworkers; • Payment to workers below the minimum legal wage or formalized agricultural benchmark; and • Inadequate access to PPE that can prevent harm from exposure to CPA and GTS.', ""In , part of our work to prevent child labor focused on strengthening the support provided to farmers and workers, including awarenessraising and training, efforts to strengthen school access and attendance, vocational training, and other initiatives to
