'The studies showed that the following were using the Botany Mashes as ‘home: otters, yellowfaced bee, saltmarsh shortspur beetle, viviparous lizard, harvest mouse and the Cetti warbler.', 'The analysis showed that the deterioration was avoidable through active intervention to prevent the marsh from drying out and scrub taking over.', 'BRM developed a project to divert rainwater from its main road into a new pond, which would then naturally feed into a ditch system to maintain the wetness of the marsh.', 'This included digging, creating pathways and clearing the ditches.', 'Today, the diversion of clean offsite water, which previously flowed through BRMs land, has also improved BRMs management of its onsite water during heavy rain events.', 'In early , the local community began to

management infrastructure and rigorous maintenance • Treatment of open pit and underground water to provide additional wet season storage capacity • Maintenance of river gauging stations and early warning flood systems • The renegotiation of an approved waste water discharge licence to give more flexibility for the release of water As the severe rain hit the local area, the good planning delivered results, there was no uncontrolled discharge of water from the mine site, and downstream areas were protected.', 'One of the keys to achieving this result was the establishment of onsite capacity to analyse water samples with a certified laboratory.', 'This meant the mine could quickly understand the quality of water from different sources and deal with it accordingly.', 'The safety
