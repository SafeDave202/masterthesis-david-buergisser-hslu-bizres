minimal cost to the environment.', '“ We can act on climate change, and so we will.', '” Thomas Widmer Chief Operating Officer, Zurich Corporate Social Responsibility Report Our environmental approach Due to the nature of Avaloqs business, our carbon footprint is relatively small compared to other sectors of the economy, but this is no excuse for inaction.', 'Instead, we aim to create a sustainable, lowcarbon future by remaining a climate neutral company, powering our operations with % renewable energy and raising environmental awareness within our community.', 'Managing our carbon emissions We keenly observe and adjust our operations to function on renewable energy and achieve climate neutrality.', 'Our carbon emissions arise primarily from business travel and the energy consumed in our offices and data centres.', 'We measure our carbon footprint annually with the Greenhouse Gas Protocols Scope , , and system: The most important step is to reduce the creation of greenhouse gas emissions.', 'We do this by encouraging telecommunication over unnecessary travel and limiting flights in business class to specific cases.', 'On top of this, Avaloq aims to continuously reduce the use of paper in all our offices and offers ebikes for business and personal purposes.', 'Our other option is offsetting.', 'It entails neutralizing unavoidable emissions by financing carbon offsetting projects.', 'These consist of purchasing carbon credits that represent the removal or avoidance of one metric tonne of carbon dioxide or its equivalent from the atmosphere.', 'These credits will finance muchneeded climate mitigation action and support the global transition to a zerocarbon future.', '• Scope : Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources e.g.', 'purchased electricity, heat and steam • Scope : Other indirect emissions that occur in a companys value chain e.g.', 'purchased goods and services, business travel, employee commuting, waste disposal We set as our baseline year, and in , our relative emissions were % lower.', 'Scope direct and Scope indirect emissions were tonnes of CO equivalent COe and represented % of our total footprint.', 'Our Scope from emissions business travel.', 'tonnes of COe, mostly topped , e O C s n o T , , , Carbon emissions by scope Scope Scope Scope Corporate Social Responsibility Report Climate neutral designation Although our focus is reducing our carbon footprint, we also want to minimize the climate impact of those emissions we cannot yet avoid.', 'Therefore, we purchase and retire an equivalent volume of independently verified carbon credits on the voluntary carbon market for Scope , Scope , and Scope unavoidable emissions.', 'This is how we achieved the Climate Neutral Company label by South Pole in , related to operations.', 'We are committed to achieving the same recognition for our operations.', 'Business travel emissions While the pandemic reduced our business travel emissions by %, it remains our single largest source of CO emissions, representing % of our total carbon footprint in .', 'Aside from our staff working from home during the pandemic, we also successfully transitioned internal business functions like recruitment, learning and development, and global events such as the Avaloq Community Experience to the digital space, with outstanding outcomes.', 'This suggests that we can retain some of these gains without sacrificing business excellence.', 'To further raise awareness, our online travelbooking tool now shows the greenhouse gas emissions per flight prior to booking and promotes the selection of less carbonintensive travel options.', 'Powering Avaloq with renewable energy In , we focused on sourcing clean, renewable energy and improving efficiency throughout our operations.', 'In fact, % of the electricity we consumed from the grid was procured from renewable sources.', 'Our target is to purchase % of our electricity from verified renewable sources for our operations too.', 'We can achieve this ambitious target through the purchase of Energy Attribute Certificates EACs equal to our total megawatt hour MWh consumption.', 'Each EAC represents proof that one MWh of renewable energy has been produced and injected into the grid.', 'Therefore, by purchasing EACs equal to our total grid consumption that is not green, we can be confident that all our gridsourced electricity came from renewable sources and was generated with zero carbon.', 'Corporate Social Responsibility Report www.avaloq.com']"
