question of how success can be reframed and defined when it comes to tackling child labor.', 'We have helped , children, both within and outside our direct supply chain.', 'Community service groups

child labor.', 'Remediation is about supporting children, their families and communities to remove children from a situation of risk.', 'The majority of remediation activities to date have focused on education, activities to improve family income and assistance with farmrelated work.', 'Every case of child labor is different.', 'This is why most children in the remediation system receive multiple forms of support tailored to their individual needs.', 'One form of support the CLMRS brings to children in child labor is awareness raising.', 'The majority of remediation activities demonstrate a fairly similar rate of success for all children on average.', 'Taking this type of systematic approach should help improve the effectiveness of the system overall.', 'When we look at remediations in terms of the age profile of the children, awareness raising, incomegenerating activities and adult literacy classes for parents are more effective at helping younger children than older ones.', 'The other types of remediation, based on our experience to date, seem to be similarly effective for children in all age groups.', 'A major risk factor is having illiterate parents particularly illiterate mothers.', 'However, we find that for children of illiterate mothers, certain types of remediation are particularly effective: this is the case for bridging classes, birth certificates, interventions in schools such as renovating classrooms and tutoring.', 'As the amount of data in our system grows, this information has the potential to help us make more informed decisions when offering remediation.', 'Since , we have uncovered three violations of forced labor guidelines and immediately took action to report and remedy them.', 'Since the publication of the Tackling Child Labor Report, no further instances of forced labor have been identified.', 'This does not mean that forced labor does not exist it may be that we are not good enough at identifying it.', 'According to the International Labour Organization ILO, child labor is: ‘Work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development. In Côte dIvoire, the government has specified hazardous tasks in cocoa cultivation which fall into eight broad categories that are strictly forbidden for children to do.', 'This task is in no way hazardous to their health, nor does it interfere with their schooling if done only occasionally.', 'Hazardous activities associated with cases of child labor in cocoa cultivation Carrying heavy loads

Note: The use of sharp tools is a new classification introduced under Ivorian law in Identifying children at risk The causes of child labor are unique to each child, which makes it a challenging issue to address.', 'Poverty and demographics Culture and tradition Many farmers involve their children in work because they intend to provide them with useful, practical training for potential future careers as farmers.', 'Additionally, there is a lack of awareness involved.', 'The average cocoa farmer in Ghana earns less than per day, well below the extreme poverty line of .', 'There are fewer young professional farmers in rural areas in Côte dIvoire to sustain cocoa growing communities.', 'Against this backdrop of an ageing farming population are contrasting countrywide demographics.', 'These demographic trends create a fertile environment for child labor to exist.', 'They also help explain why, in so many cases, farmers maintain that they need their children to help them in the fields.', 'Moreover, with only .% of the rural population having access to electricity in Côte dIvoire, many students are unable to study in the evenings because of a lack of light.', '% of the worlds

addition.', 'Discussions about child labor are among these.', 'When this notion of child labor prevails, the solution seems clear: arrest the law breakers who created this scenario and return the children to the safe havens in which they lived before.', 'The importance of language Even using the term “child labor” poses a challenge.', 'It forces us into a binary way of thinking, whereby a child is either clearly “a laborer” or not.', 'Such thinking suggests that children can “move out” of labor into a permanent state of nonlabor, for which a proxy term is often “in school.” Over the course of this reports production, the team and I had an ongoing conversation about the language we were using, so that it would best reflect the realities of childrens lives based on learnings from our respective research and field studies.', 'How do we categorize the % of children who are involved in harmful labor, but who also attend school?', 'To take an example from my own fieldwork: how should I write about the young teenage boy from a caring family, wellnourished and educated, who walked with me and his father to the family plot, carrying a bucket of liquid pesticide that a professional sprayer then applied to the trees?', 'Is he, or is he not, a “child laborer”?', 'I raise this point about language because the terms we use to describe and define child labor impact how we measure success in reducing it.', 'If we rely solely upon a binary classification of “permanent child laborer” or “never child laborer,” it will seem as if little progress has been made.', 'One of the important contributions of Nestlés Tackling Child Labor Report is raising awareness of the We must reject a binary notion of success, in which only children who have demonstrably moved permanently out of any labor scenario are “counted.” complexity of child labor through sensitive, honest case studies that illustrate a range of situations and outcomes.', 'We dont want children to be in danger, either.” People along the cocoa supply chain, from farm to port, have with great patience and clarity helped me to see what child labor looks like from their points of view, embedded within the rural realities that define their lives and livelihoods.', 'When we are discussing its economic importance, farmers often tell me that cocoa enables life improvements that would otherwise not be possible.', 'Child labor interventions must reflect and respond to rural realities.', 'Harm reduction may look very different from village to village, family to family, and child to child.', 'It does mean that we must reject a binary notion of success, in which only children who have demonstrably moved permanently out of any labor scenario are “counted.” While there is much left to be learned, the constellation of family circumstances, local infrastructure, and farming realities that make it more or less likely that a child will be involved in hazardous work are broadly understood.', 'A good example from the Nestlé Cocoa Plan is the maternal literacy program.', 'While womens literacy alone will not stop all children doing hazardous work, it likely reduces the probability and makes it more likely that remediation activities that provide access to and retention in education will be beneficial.', 'That is success.', 'Child labor in cocoa will not be eradicated overnight.', 'But as cocoa farmers have explained to me, and as this report demonstrates, reducing its incidence is not only possible, it is already happening.', 'With sensitivity, constant learning and ongoing investment, a more secure future lies within reach for children in cocoa.', 'But it is also important for children who have already been found doing hazardous work.', 'Thats why we have focused on appropriate and welltargeted educational initiatives since the launch of our CLMRS in , such as building and renovating schools and funding bridging classes.', 'We have learned a lot along the way, and together with our partners, we continuously test and adapt our approach, scaling up the remediation activities that the evidence shows work best.', 'minutes per day spent in hazardous work when a child is enrolled in school day per week where hazardous work is performed if a child is enrolled in school A childs right to education Education is included in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.', 'Without education, children are deprived of their ability to realize their human potential.', 'Thats why, in addition to tackling child labor, the Nestlé Cocoa Plan directly supports activities that improve access to education for entire communities.', 'We now know for certain that there is a reduced likelihood of child labor in households where the head of household is literate.', 'Unsurprisingly, there is a correlation between villages without a primary school and parents who are illiterate.', 'Where children have lengthy walks to get to school, or when there is no school within reach, there is a higher risk of child labor.', 'Building and refurbishing schools is much more than a corporate social responsibility activity.', 'It is an integral part of our child labor remediation strategy in communities where the lack of educational facilities contributes to the prevalence of child labor.', 'School refurbishment is helping to address the particularly challenging school conditions in rural areas.', 'At a national level, in rural areas in Côte dIvoire, % of schools lack electricity, % lack waterpoints and % lack toilets.', 'Building toilets With so many schools lacking adequate toilets in rural areas, some children, especially girls, journey back home or to a relatives house to use the toilet.', 'Others are forced to venture into the bush, despite risks from wildlife or harassment.', 'This undermines girls education and contributes to absenteeism and dropout.', 'Investing in sanitation Many of our investments in sanitation have been made possible through Nestlés longstanding Water, Sanitation and Hygiene WASH partnership with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies IFRC.', 'Together, we have delivered clean drinking water, sanitation facilities and hygiene training for more than , people in West Africa since .', 'In Côte dIvoire between and , the WASH program built or repaired toilets and handwashing facilities in schools, established school hygiene clubs and delivered hygiene awareness training to , children.', 'Nestlé and IFRC are now working to scale up the approach and its benefits in Ghana through the GhaWASH initiative.', 'Opening canteens Having food available at schools means that children no longer need to make the journey home for a meal at lunchtime.', 'School canteens can help with retention and attendance, preventing pupils dropping out and also boosting childrens ability to concentrate.', 'We have delivered , school kits to children since the launch of the Nestlé Cocoa Plan, including items such as chalk, pens, course books, and erasers.', 'There are six types of kit with content corresponding to a childs age and educational needs.', 'Virtual classrooms Eneza Education is a social enterprise providing access to learning through mobile technology for students who need additional support, or who cannot access school.', 'Used to supplement, not replace formal schooling, they are the largest virtual classroom in Africa with over .', 'million learners.', 'The results are being closely monitored to see if the program could be further rolled out across the Nestlé Cocoa Plan.', 'Many births in rural Côte dIvoire go unregistered for cost reasons, or even because of superstition.', 'In addition, many families lost their childrens birth certificates while fleeing the violence of the civil war.', 'We collaborate with local authorities to issue birth certificates to the students who need them.', 'School kits Many families cannot afford school uniforms or basic school supplies and must make financial sacrifices to acquire them.', 'Bridging classes Children who start education late, or who have dropped out and subsequently attempt to reenter school, can find they have fallen too far behind to keep up.', 'A bridging class is designed to help children make up lost ground without experiencing social stigma see case study on page .', 'We partner with the Jacobs Foundation to deliver these ninemonth courses in cocoa farming communities throughout the country.', 'School management committees With our partners, we help with the setup, training and support of school management committees.', 'Partnering with the Jacobs Foundation The Nestlé Cocoa Plan partners with organizations that have expert knowledge of the challenges facing cocoagrowing communities and a proven record of delivering meaningful results.', 'As our partner, we rely on their extensive educational experience to help us deliver effective bridging schools in Côte dIvoire.', 'However, they were overcrowded, their infrastructure was crumbling and learning conditions were difficult.', '“There is enough space, it makes learning easier and the children always come to school.', 'But the new school allowed us to reach % % within a year of opening.” A positive side effect of the new school building was the impact that it had on the towns other schools, which were able to transfer some of their pupils to the new Didoko school.', 'In the three years since Didoko was opened, the other schools have also seen an academic improvement, with teachers enjoying more manageable class sizes and more time to focus on each child.', 'Child labor rates are lower in communities where a primary school is present.', 'However, improving school infrastructure is timeconsuming and expensive, so unless large numbers of children are identified at risk, more targeted interventions are usually prioritized.', 'C a s e S t u d y A BRIGHTER FUTURE % of children identified doing hazardous tasks were carrying heavy loads Of all the dangerous tasks that children are found doing, carrying heavy loads is the most common “School means success,” says Paul, a yearold cocoa farmer from a village in Côte dIvoire.', '“I want my children to be successful so I send them to school.” But that hasnt always been easy for Paul.', 'Yet putting his children through school remains a priority for him.', 'Perhaps this is because he is literate himself, and he values the opportunities that education can offer his children in the long term.', 'But life is hard here.', 'When the local Community Liaison Person visited Pauls household, three of his children had been carrying heavy loads in the last six months.', 'Instead, most were wood, water or food.', 'million children in Côte dIvoire do not have birth certificates.', 'Nestlé has also taken action in D. at a community level, building a new school in the town.', 'This has massively relieved the pressure on the towns four older schools, which were badly overcrowded see page .', 'There are six types of school kit that are issued according to a childs age and school level.', 'However, typically we may include items such as the following: • A schoolbag • French and mathematics textbooks • Notebooks and protective covers • Stationery such as pens and pencils, erasers and sharpeners • Blackboard and chalk • Mathematics set “The construction of the school by Nestlé has been very beneficial to this village,” agreed Denis, the headteacher of one of the older schools.', '“Hes a good boy and pays attention in class.', 'Like every child from a low income background, the support he gets at home is limited because his parents dont have a lot of money.', 'Hes a nice kid hes sociable and plays with his friends.', 'In terms of grades hes average, so overall, hes doing fine.', 'With some support, I think he could go quite far in his studies.” Ezechiels older brother Ghislain, , had also been identified doing hazardous work carrying heavy loads at the same time as attending school.', 'A brilliant student, Ghislain received the secondhighest grades in his class over the last academic year.', '“I like Spanish,” he explained, “and I want to become a Spanish teacher.” To assist Paul in meeting the costs of keeping Ghislain in school and out of the fields, we provided a school kit.', '“The school kit helped me because it helped my dad too,” Ghislain explained.', '“To help children you have to help their parents cover expenses.” “The construction of the school by Nestlé has been very beneficial to this village” Looking to the future, Paul has high hopes for his son.', 'My hope is that he will be someone important in the village.” Ezechiel meanwhile says he likes school and he has big plans of his own for the future.', 'This seems to have been, at least for now, a relatively straightforward and successful way to prevent child labor.', 'C a s e S t u d y Deep in Côte dIvoires cocoa belt, the small village of T. is normally quiet during the day because most of the men and women are working in the fields.', 'Some of the children go to the local school.', 'To reach it, they walk along the villages heavily potholed, unsurfaced roads.', 'A BRIDGE BACK TO LEARNING “We couldnt afford to send her to school” That was exactly what happened to ten yearold Adissa.', 'School starting age came and went.', 'Adissas father is a cocoa grower supplying Nestlé, while Aliman grows Arachis peanut plants.', 'She would give Adissa little tasks to do around her field to keep her occupied.', 'Aliman would then either sell the nuts or crush them into a paste, to cook dishes like kedjenou a spicy slowcooked stew.', 'In Alimans defense, weeding with a daba used to be considered an acceptable task for children until a law change in Côte dIvoire in , which prohibited the use of sharp tools.', 'Across the village, another girl of the same age was in a similar position.', 'At that time, her father was not a supplier to the Nestlé Cocoa Plan though now, two years on, he has started the certification program to become one.', 'A bridge into mainstream education Samou used to weigh the villagers cocoa before it was sent to the local coop so he knew most of the producers in the area personally.', 'That was why he was selected by his coop to become a Community Liaison Person.', 'It was Samou who first spotted Adissa and Emmanuella scraping the weeds in their mothers fields.', '“The bridging class brings together children who have not been able to access education, either because they dropped out or never had the chance to start with,” says the bridging schoolteacher.', '“Its very welcome because it integrates children back into the education system and stops them from going to the fields.” The course delivers two years of national curriculum in just nine months The course is highly focused on each childs development and delivers two years worth of national curriculum in just nine months.', 'Class sizes are small and the standard of the children graduating is high.', 'They generally integrate well into the mainstream school system following the course their grades are comparable to those of their peers, despite years of missed schooling.', 'Adissa and Emmanuella both excelled here and moved into mainstream school the following year.', '“There are lots of students from the bridge school that are in our classes now,” explains Adissas teacher at the village primary school.', '“Looking at the results of the children that come through the project we have a lot of hope for them.', 'Overall, she had the second best grades in the class last year.', '“I really am.” As for Emmanuella, she hopes to continue her education and go on to become a doctor.', '“I want to be able to give people injections one day.” g n i t r o p p u S s d o o h i l e v i l Better farming Large households, limited access to the financial system, the lack of a social safety net, and falling yields from ageing trees can all put financial pressure on families.', 'We encourage income diversification and womens empowerment, teach better farming practices and enable access to basic financial services.', 'Better lives other crops or raise animals.', 'Keeping bees is relatively low cost, good for the environment and does not compete with other crops for land use.', 'We hope that the pilot will allow farmers to extract more value from their land and help ease cashflow between cocoa harvests.', 'We have also helped found womens groups, supplying machinery and tools to help them generate their own incomes, independent of their husbands and outside of cocoa.', 'In July , the Côte dIvoire and Ghana governments introduced a USD per tonne ‘Living Income Differential LID to help support farmers through a higher price for their cocoa.', 'This will be for the crop.', 'We strongly believe cocoa farmers should earn an income that allows them to maintain a decent and adequate standard of living for them and their families.', 'Price is one of the levers to achieve this, and we have started buying the crop, including the LID.', 'In order to achieve a decent standard of living, we also help farmers to improve their yields from their cocoa trees, as well as diversifying income sources to grow have smaller yields and are more susceptible to disease, which is why we have distributed .', 'million healthy new cocoa trees to farmers to help protect their yields and support their longterm income generation.', 'We are also planting .', 'million shade trees.', 'While these will have minimal impact on incomes in the short term, these large native tree species will make cocoa production more sustainable in the long term.', 'They provide protection from the sun, help regulate humidity, help maintain soil fertility, provide more biodiversity and absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.', 'This will all help to protect cocoa farming from the effects of climate change.', 'Disease, climate change and ageing trees frequently impact cocoa yields.', 'While the farmers in our supply chain are independent farmers who make their own decisions, we can support them a lot by encouraging them to implement best agricultural practices.', 'Similarly, ageing cocoa trees Financial training and access can also borrow in small amounts from the fund at times of need.', 'The interest accrued on the members accumulated savings is distributed back to members annually.', 'These facilities have the potential to give farmers more control over their finances, encourage saving and can ease cashflow before harvests when costs are highest, and savings are often running low.', 'In a similar vein, we have established several community service groups within coops.', 'These are made up of local farmers or hired laborers who are available to help producers at harvest time.', 'All of these activities help to improve farmers financial situations, which in turn, help to tackle one of the underlying causes of child labor.', 'In January , along with one of our suppliers Cocoanect, we launched a capacitybuilding initiative called the Farmer Business School in Ghana.', 'Participating farmers learned skills aimed at helping them to better manage their finances and to diversify their livelihoods.', 'Having started with

me.', 'Underneath it, she writes the customers details and the length of the cloth required to fulfill the order.', 'In almost all cocoa producing villages in this region of Côte dIvoire, there is a high level of illiteracy.', 'But there are also traditional and cultural reasons why people didnt go to school.', '“It was often just the village elite, and then the rest didnt go.', 'Thats especially true for girls.', 'Traditionally, girls were encouraged to focus more on gaining domestic skillsets at home.', 'In terms of reaching higher education, girls often get married young as well.', 'So, there is a cultural weight that stops girls getting access to education as easily as boys.” Yet, our CLMRS data clearly show us that there is a negative correlation between womens literacy and the likelihood of child labor.', 'Women who can read and write are less likely to allow their children to engage in dangerous tasks.', 'Nathan explains, “all the actions we take are designed to reduce child labor.', 'We hope that they will make it less likely for children to undertake dangerous activities and more likely that they go to school.', 'This kind of preventative work, done at a community

'Underlying challenges Awareness and understanding Certain aspects of the laws surrounding child labor can be confusing for farmers and can directly conflict with their beliefs and traditions.', 'Understanding is fundamental to the behavior change that is needed to effectively tackle child labor.', 'It is for this reason that conducting community awareness raising is high on our agenda, with over half a million attendees reached to date.', 'Changing cooperative and household dynamics Cooperative membership is fluid.', 'This is why we have expanded our team of CLPs, who each manage an average farming households within their communities.', 'Family illness, the death of a parent, a case of child abuse or divorce may render a remediation irrelevant, ineffective or both.', 'This is why over twothirds of the children who we help with remediation support receive three or more different types of remediation activity.', 'This is partially offset by the CLPs living in the villages and being part of the community.', 'They require more bespoke remediations such as vocational training.', 'This would have the dual benefits of providing educational vocational support to older children and could help to address the current deficit of young people who want careers in cocoa farming.', 'Culturally, if not legally, they are already considered adults to a large degree.', 'They are

have begun to clear and he leaves to check that his bike is ready for tomorrow.', 'Give children a voice to help stop child labor An external perspective from Dr Amanda Berlan, an Associate Professor specializing in the ethics and socioeconomic sustainability of cocoa production at De Montfort University.', 'Dr Amanda Berlan is an anthropologist specialising in cocoa production.', 'Since , she has worked extensively on issues relating to childrens rights, community development and global value chains.', 'She has undertaken fieldwork in West Africa, India and the Caribbean, and she has a keen interest in promoting an evidencebased approach to tackling sustainability problems.', 'When I started my PhD research on child labor in cocoa, which was before the issue hit mainstream news, a chocolate industry executive told me that the subject was inconsequential both to industry and consumers, and he questioned whether the practice even occurred at all.', 'Almost years on, the landscape has changed beyond recognition with enormous corporate investments, multistakeholder partnerships, sustained media interest, certification initiatives, company policies and much consumer pressure.', 'Many observers express frustration that the sectorwide objective of eliminating child labor, or at least the commitment to reduce it by % by , will not be met.', 'This is indicative of the vast and ongoing disparity between the lives of local communities and Westernbased expectations which, in spite of the changes in the last two decades, still needs to be resolved.', 'My own experience of working with cocoa farmers, their children and wider communities does not support the view that deadlines, especially those set by outsiders in different continents and with different worldviews, can easily be implemented.', 'In my own fieldwork in Ghana I saw the enormous practical hurdles that needed to be overcome to address child labor as well as the significant cultural sensitivities around the subject.', 'For example, many of the children I interviewed worked because they were hungry.', 'In our discussions about the use of machetes, children also questioned why Westerners would not want them to use them on cocoa farms.', 'This is because they used them in many other areas of their lives, including as protection against snakes and scorpions.', 'The lack of toilet facilities in most rural schools, and the possibility of sexual harassment was a deterrent for girls to be in education.', 'Both sexes were at risk of labor exploitation due to broken marriages, following which single mothers could not afford education for their children, or they remarried and stepfathers refused to pay for their stepchildrens upkeep.', 'The lack of childcare options in rural communities also meant that caregivers had to take children to farm with them.', 'This provided the children with an early and unfortunate exposure to farm work and normalized their involvement in the eyes of their communities in a way that cannot be easily reconciled with external notions of childhood.', 'The significance of this is to illustrate that child labor does not operate within a single causal framework and as a result, it cannot be rectified easily or within a specifiable timeframe.', 'A holistic approach to tackling child labor based on community remediation programs is necessary.', 'However, this is not a quick process, and it takes time to gain traction and deliver benefits for the communities involved.', 'Until now, the perspectives of children, their caregivers and wider cocoa communities have been neglected in favor of topdown approaches based on external perceptions of needs and solutions.', 'While adopting a childcentric and more participatory approach may seem a lofty aspiration, in practical terms, this is achievable.', 'Depending on the age of respondents, using a participatory approach based on a range of tools such as open interviews, life stories, drawings, photography and games, and supplementing these with more conventional methods such as focus groups, would provide much more revealing insights into the root causes of child labor as well as signal practical ways to address it.', 'For example, a clear link between child labor and chronic hungermalnutrition emerged in my own fieldwork with cocoa communities using such methods.', 'This showed that a school feeding program would have a real impact on child labor in this context.', 'Similarly, using participatory methods showed that a childs biological age typically a cornerstone of Western based interventions on child labor, was not a helpful frame of reference in cocoa communities.', 'However, these methods also brought to light alternative ways of engaging with local communities on this issue.', 'However, including childrens voices does not only make for better policymaking; it also brings businesses into line with UN recommendations on the rights of working children.', 'The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child agreed in that working children, “have to be heard in childsensitive settings, in order to understand their views of the situation and their best interests.', 'They should be included in the search for a solution, which respects the economic and sociostructural constraints as well as the cultural context under which these children work.', 'Children should also be heard when policies are developed to eliminate the root causes of child labor, in particular regarding education.” Towards a better future As I reflect on the journey of the last two decades, it is clear that corporate investments have led to positive changes in Ghana and Côte dIvoire, where there are now high levels of awareness if not compliance on the issue of child labor in cocoa.', 'While the aim of a % reduction in child labor by may not be met, there are many success stories, as this report shows.', 'We can say with confidence that we have moved on from, and will not return to, the state of ignorance we were in regarding childrens involvement in cocoa production in Ghana and Côte dIvoire.', 'Moreover, publications such as this show that the chocolate industry has become more open to holistic approaches to tackling child labor.', 'Given the unrelenting media interest in stories of child labor in chocolate, and the ongoing criticisms from external observers, we urgently need to redefine the prevailing discourse on child labor.', 'A longterm childfocused approach that is pragmatic and illustrative of a genuine commitment to childrens rights as broadly conceived in UN policies and recommendations must form the bedrock of action going forward.', 'I commend Nestlés Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System, and the conceptual and practical shifts that have characterized interventions in recent years.', 'The full unabridged version is available on www.nestlecocoaplan.com d a e h a g n k o o L i By , we aim to source % of the cocoa for our confectionery products through the Nestlé Cocoa Plan.', 'This represents a major commitment to ensuring our chocolate is sustainable.', 'Towards % sustainable cocoa By , % of the cocoa used in our confectionery products will be sourced through the Nestlé Cocoa Plan The Nestlé CLMRS is successful in tackling child labor in just over half of cases.', 'Dr Kristy Leissle reminds us that we should see child labor holistically.', 'To eliminate child labor we need farreaching changes in society, industry and policy, and we cant do this on our own.', 'Rural villages in West Africa need better water supply to reduce infant mortality and to reduce the need to carry heavy loads.', 'They need electricity to improve the quality of life, and available labor to ease pressure on older farmers.', 'They need more schools so that children have an alternative to working in the fields, and those schools need to offer quality education.', 'Are we providing better opportunities to children in the communities we source cocoa from?', 'We will continue to measure our remediation activities against success in child labor reduction, while acknowledging this is not the only success factor.', 'We also need to know: are peoples attitudes changing?', 'Are the communities more able and willing to address these issues?', 'Are local people shocked when they see a child carrying out a hazardous activity?', 'We will continue to improve the systems efficiency.', 'We are experimenting with how many villages a CLP can cover, and we are also trying fulltime rather than parttime CLPs in order to cover a larger area.', 'Having established with our partner the Jacobs Foundation that bridge schools work well, we will set up a further bridging classes to help over , children become literate and numerate so that they can reintegrate into mainstream schooling.', 'Were also taking up Dr Amanda Berlans suggestion to listen to children more.', 'We want to improve links with other aspects of the Nestlé Cocoa Plan and involve all our partners in implementing remediation.', 'We need to innovate more, piloting new remediation activities and scaling up what works.', 'A holistic approach also means improving livelihoods in cocoagrowing communities.', 'Im delighted that we will be sourcing all our cocoa for Nestlé confectionery products through the Nestlé Cocoa Plan by .', 'We will implement the CLMRS in all our sourcing from West Africa by .', 'We commit to putting all of our effort behind the system, being open about our success and challenges, and to continue to report publicly.', 'Annual numbers will be reported in our annual Nestlé in Society report, as well as on the Nestlé Cocoa Plan website, together with updates and blog posts.', ""pdf?MOD=AJPERESCVID=lKbIfAe
