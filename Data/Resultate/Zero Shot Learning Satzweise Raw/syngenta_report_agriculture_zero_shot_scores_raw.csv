four farmers are concerned about the adverse effects climate change will have on crop yields, animal health and their ability to do business over the next five years.', 'A climate scenario analysis conducted by Syngenta in showed that by the year , growers would be coping with increased risks from droughts and floods.', 'Among other insights, the analysis showed that by offering farmers products that can help them adapt to climate change, Syngenta can tap into new market opportunities related to the transition to a lowcarbon economy.', 'As the world begins to recover from the shock of the pandemic, Syngenta is placing the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss at the heart of its support to farmers.', 'The new fiveyear Good Growth Plan we launched in June includes four bold

change and create a food system that works in harmony with nature.', 'Syngentas recent acquisition of Valagro, a leading company in the field of biological products for agriculture, advanced our strategy to provide farmers with more product and technology choices and underscored our determination to make agriculture more resilient and sustainable.', 'None of these accomplishments would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our people during this incredibly challenging year.', 'At the onset of the COVID outbreak, Syngenta immediately took measures to keep our
