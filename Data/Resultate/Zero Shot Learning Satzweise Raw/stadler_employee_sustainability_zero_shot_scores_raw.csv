our cities conti nue to grow, so too will the demand for transport capacity.', 'For Stadler, this is an opportunity to expand further and to generate value for our customers and shareholders.', 'Stadler wants to ensure that this growth is sustainable, while at the same time protecting the environment and conserving resources.', 'Further more, we want to measure our impact on society and the envi ronment wherever possible, and make this information trans parent for all stakeholders.', 'For this reason, we are pleased to announce that, starting this year, we will regularly report on our progress in terms of sustainability and share these updates with you.', 'The Sustainability Report offers information about our approach and the current state of our ongoing projects in the areas of gov ernance, products, employees, the environment and society.', ""Our strategies and actions are based on the United Nations' Sustain able Development Goals SDGs."", 'In , we are planning to for mulate a sustainability strategy and to further expand our sus tainability management measures in the coming years.', 'Over the course of the year, we delivered vehicles, which is roughly per cent more than in the previous year.', 'By continually developing our railway vehicles and services, we are doing our part to help reduce global green house gas GHG emissions and minimise the ecological foot print of railway transport.', 'With this report, we not only want to give an account of our environmental management measures and our role as an at tractive employer for the first time ever; we also want to offer the reader a glimpse into the design and development processes that go into manufacturing rolling stock.', 'In , Stadler invest ed a great deal in digitalisation, new vehicle concepts and new technologies.', 'The results of this investment include, for exam ple, the innovative batteryoperated FLIRT, a completely new tram model, as well as the FLIRT H, a hydrogenpowered mul tiple unit.', 'In order to increase the capacity of the existing infrastructure, we must be able to operate more trains on these systems.', 'This is made possible through increased automation.', 'Intelligent, connected trains are more punctual and consume less energy.', 'For this reason, demand for driverassistance systems, which are similar to autopilot systems in airplanes, will become in creasingly important for trains as well.', 'These Automatic Train Operation systems ATO systems move trains at constant speeds and with energyoptimised running behaviour.', 'Stadler has developed its own ATO system, which is currently being test ed in Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden.', 'Depending on the traffic situation, ATO systems make it possible to increase capacity by up to per cent and to save up to per cent in terms of energy consumption.', 'We believe that with safe, comfortable, environmentallyfriendly railway vehicles, we can get even more people excited about travelling by train or tram.', 'This is why we act responsibly and demonstrate our commitment in all countries where Stadler trains are in operation.', 'Table of contents — Stadler Sustainability Report TABLE OF

Report — Stadler Rail Group SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY The subject of sustainable drive systems has deep roots in Stadler's history thanks to the efforts of its founder and first owner, Ernst Stadler ."", 'Having studied high and lowvoltage engineering and with a passion for innovation, Ernst Stadler was interested in automobiles and their electrical systems from early on.', 'At that time, resources such as fuel coal and mineral oil were becoming increasingly scarce due to the Second World War.', 'Electricity from local hydropower was the most environmentally friendly option.', 'Before the end of the Second World War, Ernst Stadler founded his own company with a focus on converting vehicles to battery operation.', 'Brick factories in particular were interested in the electrically operated locomotives since their businesses were also impacted by fuel rationing measures.', 'As a result, Ernst Stadler began to spend more time developing an electrical drive for the conversion of locomotives.', 'He placed a great deal of im portance on the durability of his designs in order to ensure that they were optimally suited to the environments in which they would be used.', 'Because his batteryoperated locomotives soon reached their limits on long routes, Ernst Stadler devel oped the first generation of bimodal locomotives for powering industrial railways for the International Rhine Regulation Rail way IRR.', 'These locomotives were equipped with a battery that allowed them to travel short distances without a contact line.', ""This short anecdote demonstrates how Ernst Stadler's pioneer ing spirit and innovative ideas were able to turn the use of loco motives with electric drives into the cornerstone of Stadler's sustainability concept, which is reflected today in the compa ny's current sustainability efforts within the global context of climate change."", 'Since these early sustainability efforts, Stadler has become a large company with a widereaching impact.', 'Given its expansion in recent years, Stadler wants to assume responsibility for its growing number of employees and business activities along with the resulting environmental impact.', 'According to the Inter governmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC, the industrial sector is responsible for around onefifth of the global green house gas emissions caused by economic activities.', 'Stadler wants to do its part to prevent climate change.', 'Stadler recognises its corporate responsibility to society and aims to strike a balance between the three dimensions of sus tainability economy, ecology and society in all of its busi ness activities.', 'Our efforts include our products and services, production facilities, employees, business partners as well as other stakeholders.', 'By offering innovative, longlasting trans port solutions, we contribute to the sustainable mobility of the future and generate value for future generations.', 'The Stadler Rail Group pursues a decentralised management approach that not only considers the various requirements of the different divisions, but also of the various regions where our facilities are located.', 'Moreover, all of the divisions are run based on the latest management, environmental and safety systems in accordance with the relevant ISO standards such as and see also the table on page in chapter .', 'We have a number of established structures and processes in place that contribute to the sustainable development of the company, in particular our QEHS management system.', 'Ernst Stadler right in front of his first batteryoperated vehicle.', 'Stadler Rail Group — Stadler Sustainability Report ny has defined five key areas of action that will be used to struc ture its efforts from here on.', 'The chapters of this ini tial sustainability report have been divided up into these areas: governance, products and services, employees and leadership, environment and society.', ""To develop and firmly anchor a comprehensive sustainability strategy within the company, Stadler is planning to implement the following measures by the time the next Sustainability Report is published: • Execution of a materiality analysis in accordance with the GRI standard • Definition of Groupwide sustainability guidelines in the • Definition of binding, Groupwide targets • Involvement in sustainability partnerships •

speeds steadily increased and even though most carriages are now airconditioned.', 'Stadler also played a role in this positive development.', 'The company works tirelessly to improve the energy efficiency of its products in operation.', 'This involves designing vehicles with minimal air resistance and using aerodynamic materials to coat the car bodies.', ""However, the energy consumption of the train's drive system is a crucial aspect."", 'Advances in technology, in particular in terms of power transformation and intelligent powertrain control, have made it possible for railway vehicles to become even more effi cient.', 'Moreover, most Stadler multiple units use electrody namic brakes for the majority of braking operations.', 'This makes it possible to recover up to per cent of the deceleration ener gy and feed it back into the contact line network recuperation.', 'We try to actively reduce the use of air brakes, because they can only transform the kinetic energy of the train into heat, which is then lost and cannot be used.', 'Trains also consume energy when they are stationary for example to cool the drive units, for air conditioning and for ven tilation.', 'We are also continuously working to improve efficiency in this area in order to meet the growing demands of our cus tomer base.', 'As a result, cooling of the power converters, trans formers and motors is now

optimised speed profile, which reduces energy consumption.', 'Furthermore, the reduction of headway also increases capacity and operational reliability.', 'Smooth operation without abrupt braking also increases passenger comfort, minimises wear on the drive and break systems and the tracks, and reduces noise emissions.', 'Inspections of the Stadler ATO solution in the Czech Republic have shown that it can reduce energy costs by up to per cent.', 'In cooperation with the Swiss railway industry, SBB and Stadler tested the new digital assistance system on the newly built BernOlten route.', ""This

opinion, which products or vehicles have the greatest potential in terms of environmental protection? .', 'Which alternative drive systems are most likely to replace diesel vehicles?', 'Right now, we need to replace as many dieseloperated vehicles as possible with lowemission vehicles.', 'In addition, it would be ideal if we could electrify all of the routes.', 'Electrically operated vehicles are already thoroughly optimised and offer few opportunities for major improvements in terms of energy efficiency.', 'For this reason, our main area of focus is on providing these vehicles with power from renewable energy sources.', 'In some cases, assistance systems are already helping drivers to operate trains in a more energyefficient way today.', 'The ability to connect with one another and with the infrastruc ture would allow all consists on a network to be operated with the least possible power.', 'It would eliminate ineffective acceleration manoeuvres or unnecessarily high speeds that consume a great deal of energy.', 'This would make it possible to drastically lower energy consumption regardless of the drive technology.', 'Dieselpowered vehicles can be replaced by lowemission vehicles in many areas, but not everywhere.', 'This means not only do we need to change the vehicles, we also need to rethink our over all operating concepts.', 'I expect that we will see battery operated vehicles for passenger transport and on shorter routes in the near to midterm.', 'In recent years, battery performance has increased dramatically and will continue to improve.', 'On longer routes, hydrogenpowered vehicles are most likely to be the most promising alternative solution.', 'However, it is a good idea not to focus on just one single alternative drive technology, but to keep hybrid solutions in mind as well.', 'Batteryoperated vehicles, for example, should be able to be operated with batteries as well as under contact wires.', 'Often the existing networks are suitable for more than one drive system.', 'Stadler Sustainability Report — Employees and leadership EMPLOYEES AND LEADERSHIP Stadler is an attractive employer for more than employees.', ""The company trains
