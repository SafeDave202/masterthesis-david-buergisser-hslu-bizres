fuels in our own yieldproducing properties between now and .', 'This report highlights where we are creating value for our stakeholders.', 'Our report focuses on four areas of responsibility: the environment, economic performance, employment and compliance.', 'We are confident that economic success and commitment to sustainable solu tions are not mutually exclusive.', 'Indeed, we believe that

use of renewable energy sources, seems to contradict the goal of costefficient construction but only at first glance.', 'The higher production costs are usually more than compensated for in the medium

Environmental conditions As a significant proportion of the energy is required to heat the buildings, the en vironmental conditions during winter have a direct effect on consumption.', 'The majority of changes in energy consumption are directly dependent on the accu mulation of heating degree days.', 'Building operation and user behaviour In addition to basic energy consumption, the occupancy of a rental space is pri marily relevant to consumption.', 'Building materials The buildings and related infrastructure are upgraded according to the respective age of construction or renovation.', 'As a rule, newer buildings account for lower specific energy consumption than older buildings.', 'This is where the largest po tential lies for reducing energy consumption and CO emissions.', 'Through
