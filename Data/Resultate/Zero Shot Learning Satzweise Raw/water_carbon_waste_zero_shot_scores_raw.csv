sustainability into practice into practice Outlook Outlook Progress Progress About this report About this report Overview Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Appendix Foreword Letter from Brad Smith In January we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by and to remove from the environment all the carbon the company emitted since its founding by .', 'Over the past year, we built on this pledge by announcing a series of commitments to be water positive by , zero waste by , and to protect ecosystems by developing a Planetary Computer.', 'When we set out on our carbon negative journey a year ago, we knew the climate crisis was urgent and required immediate attention.', 'We grounded our sustainability strategy and commitments in the belief that technology can help solve the worlds biggest challenges.', 'Microsoft has focused on sustainability for more than a decade, and we are proud of our achievements.', 'Using technology, we can do just that, including minimizing the environmental impact of our own operations and ensuring the resilience of our infrastructure to climate change.', 'We believe that by focusing on all the ways we can drive change, we can make an outsized impact on climate change.', 'We, and other organizations that are serious about an environmentally sustainable future, need to pull all levers of influence we have—our operations and as a customer, supplier, investor, employer, policy advocate, and partner in innovation to customers, organizations, and institutions around the world.', '“We believe that by focusing on all the ways we can drive change, we can make an outsized impact on climate change.', 'We, and other organizations who are serious about an environmentally sustainable future, need to pull all levers of influence we have.” Brad Smith, President Microsoft cant solve the worlds environmental challenges alone, but we can play a significant role in driving a broader societal transformation if we use our positions of influence and our technologies to effectively bring others along with us on our sustainability journey. . What should we do?', 'It required building a new sustainability vision and strategy for Microsoft through a series of industryleading commitments to be a carbon negative, water positive, zero waste company by , and to develop a new Planetary Computer to better monitor, model, and manage the worlds ecosystems.', 'Were making a bold bet to address climate change and the world will need to too.', 'To help do that, we want to become the worlds leading technology provider of sustainable solutions.', 'Report In Microsofts first annual sustainability report, we look back at how and why we made our commitments, details about them, progress to date, and key lessons we have learned.', 'We intend to not only share our successes, but also share our challenges.', 'That is why, in each section, weve also included additional information and resources to help others accelerate their progress towards a prosperous, just, and environmentally stable future.', 'Brad Smith, President Microsoft will remove from the environment all the carbon the company has emitted since its founding by .', 'Overview Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Appendix How we work Taking a principled approach Our seven principles Whenever Microsoft takes on a new and complex societal issue, we strive first to learn and then to define a principled approach to guide our efforts.', 'In , we did the same with environmental sustainability.', 'Grounding in science and math.', 'Investing in new solutions and technology.', 'Taking responsibility for our footprint.', 'Empowering customers and partners around the world.', 'Using our voice on climaterelated public policy issues.', 'Overview Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Appendix How we work continued Defining focus areas We focus on four areas—carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems—where we can scale by minimizing the negative impacts of our operations and maximizing the positive impacts of our technology.', 'While we start with our operations, our strategy expands beyond our four walls by ensuring those changes also benefit the communities in which we operate and flow into our product strategy.', 'Through technology adoption by customers and partners, we can drive positive impact across the globe, accelerated by our investments, engagement in policy, and commitment to innovation.', 'v o n o rld : i n The W ers a Custo m Microsoft:

environmental sustainability.', 'Customers and partners We will help our customers and partners around the world reduce their carbon, water, waste, and land footprints through our learnings, technology, and services.', 'Policy We will use our voice on climaterelated public policy issues.', 'We will support new public policy initiatives to accelerate carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems opportunities.', 'Driving global impact We also have programs that extend across all five pillars to drive global impact, including investment and climate science.', 'Climate Innovation Fund CIF CIF will invest billion over four years to help scale up existing climate technologies and invest in new technologies that currently dont exist or are too niche for broad adoption.', 'This work also supports Microsoft sustainability commitments in carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems.', 'As we consider investments, we prioritize those that: • Provide measurable climate impact in our four areas of focus.', '• Bring additional capital to underfunded markets where the capital need for climate solutions is not being met.', 'AI for Earth We believe that there is a massive opportunity for the technology sector to improve the way we manage the Earths natural resources.', 'In , we launched Microsofts AI for Earth program to put cloud and AI technology into the hands of the worlds leading ecologists and conservation technologists, and organizations around the world that are working to protect our planet.', 'The program increases access to AI technologies through grants, provides education on cloud and AI to increase collaboration through our community, and fuels innovation through research and strategic partnerships.', 'So far, weve empowered over organizations in more than countries around the world working on gamechanging environmental innovations.', 'Find out more here • Ensure developing economies and underserved communities benefit from climate solutions.', '• Align to Microsofts core business and that of our customers.', 'Find out more here Sustainability science Our sustainability work is guided by science.', 'We believe that overcoming societys biggest sustainability challenges will require working at the intersection of technology and the natural and social sciences.', 'We have a growing team of sustainability scientists working with researchers, businesses, governments, and nonprofit organizations around the world to help Microsoft, its customers and partners, and the world to build a more environmentally sustainable future.', 'This involves creating new knowledge and tools that enable improved management of environmental resources and mitigation of risks from local to global scales.', 'Overview Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Appendix Outlook A look ahead from Lucas Joppa This must be a decade of ambition paired with action.', 'At Microsoft, we appreciate the urgency, responsibility, risks, and opportunities ahead.', 'For Microsoft to do well, we need the world to do well.', 'This belief is why our mission is to empower every person on the planet to achieve more, and why our CEO, Satya Nadella, stated, “the purpose of a corporation is to find profitable solutions to problems of people and the planet.“ Unfortunately, brought an array of new challenges to this already complex work.', 'COVID has devastated human lives in every corner of the globe, while climate change caused unprecedented environmental and economic damages.', 'While vaccines are becoming available as a solution for COVID, solutions for climate change will require deploying a host of different tools to combat the many drivers of climate change.', 'For the survival of people and our planet, this is a battle we cant afford to lose.', 'This will require the dedication of individuals, organizations, and governments, all focused on stabilizing Earths climate and properly managing its natural resources.', 'We have a limited amount of time to accomplish what will be the most significant behavioral and technological societal transformation in modern human history.', 'By , society must be well on its way to mitigating and adapting to rapidly changing climates, ensuring resilient water supplies, reducing the amount of waste we generate, and reversing the ongoing and catastrophic degradation of ecosystems while halting the extinction of species.', 'At Microsoft we appreciate the urgency, responsibility, risks, and opportunities ahead.', 'That is why a little over a year ago we began a process to transform our companys work on sustainability to better align with the scope, scale, and speed of the worlds environmental challenges and yettobe created solutions.', '“Addressing six enabling “ Addressing six enabling conditions will ultimately conditions will ultimately dictate the success or failure dictate the success or failure of the sustainability agenda of the sustainability agenda this decade—for Microsoft this decade—for Microsoft and the world.” and the world.” Dr. Lucas Joppa, Chief Environmental Officer Dr. Lucas Joppa, Chief Environmental Officer Six enabling conditions As we worked to set and implement our commitments to become carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste and to deploy a Planetary Computer, some of these global challenges came into sharp focus.', 'There is a suite of enabling conditions that must exist for Microsoft and the world to effectively and efficiently achieve a more sustainable and just future.', 'The enabling conditions that we must address inside Microsoft are clear—broadening and strengthening our governance and accountability frameworks while building a culture of sustainability investment and innovation.', 'But it will be the creation of six enabling conditions outside Microsoft that will ultimately dictate success or failure of the sustainability agenda.', 'Resolving or improving these conditions will ensure a coherent, coordinated, costefficient approach to individual and collective action on climate change.', 'Risk recognition Without a holistic assessment of risk, it is difficult for companies to efficiently manage their sustainability challenges.', 'Unfortunately, the scale and societal interdependencies of climate risk make a comprehensive assessment difficult.', 'By , a widely adopted and comprehensive risk framework will need to be in place to ensure every business can fully integrate environmental risk at the core of their corporate governance process.', 'By , Microsoft will By , Microsoft will remove more carbon than it remove more carbon than it emits.', 'By , we will remove emits.', 'By , we will remove all historical emissions.', 'Overview Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Appendix Outlook continued Standards setting Standards and globally accepted definitions drive efficiency, clarity, and interoperability.', 'For corporate sustainability commitments to be meaningful, we must ensure that everyone is working from the same taxonomy.', 'Without standards we wont be able to compare one companys netzero commitment to any other, and more time will be spent trying to assess whether a commitment is meaningful than will be in making meaningful progress on sustainability.', 'If we cant do basic math on carbon numbers from different sources because they were created using different methods, then how will we be able to track progress on emissions reductions and carbon removal, or incentivize suppliers or customers to improve their impact?', 'Solving this means that society needs to make rapid advances on agreeable sustainability standards.', 'Companies are used to coming together within a sector to collectively advance industry standards.', 'By well before , we must be operating in a world where companies have come together across sectors to agree on common sustainability units and methods of measurement.', 'Data digitization Organizations sustainability data systems are often analog, siloed, and oneoff—if they exist at all.', 'Digital monitoring and recording systems of carbon emissions, water consumption, waste generation, and ecosystem health at an operational and planetary level will be the foundation upon which the private sector will ensure transparency, meaningfully inform policy advances, and unleash the creativity of markets to help build new solutions.', 'By , we must be operating in a world where digitized and standardized sustainability data are the platform that allows society to stitch together the incredible dimensionality of the sustainability landscape from the bottom up, and analyze them from the top down.', 'Risk recognition .', 'Standards setting .', 'Data digitization .', 'Market maturation .', 'Policy progression A

'Digitized sustainability data must become a platform that allows society to stitch together the dimensionality of the sustainability landscape from the bottom up, and analyze them from the top down.', 'Most climate investments will need to fit within a wellstructured and accepted framework that aligns investment vehicles along an appropriate risktolerance spectrum, targeted on the most impactful areas.', 'Carbon offset and removal, water replenishment, and ecosystem service markets can supply greater and growing demand, transparently and with standard insurance guarantees.', 'A globally coordinated policy regime should be in place that limits emissions in line with a .ºC future, while respecting political sovereignty and the crossboundary nature of the Earth΄s life support systems, and does so with a focus on the need to equitably share these resources across cultures and communities.', 'Overview Carbon Water Waste Ecosystems Appendix Outlook continued Innovation investment Not all solutions to our sustainability challenges are available today, and those that are available are often earlystage, too expensive, or dont currently scale.', 'There is already a large and growing amount of capital starting to flow into the climate and sustainability markets to help with these issues, but little agreement on the framework that should guide these investments.', 'Attracting the amount of capital required and deploying it optimally means that by , most climate investments will need to fit within a wellstructured and accepted climate investment framework that places the large constellation of investment vehicles along an appropriate risktolerance spectrum while thoughtfully targeting the most impactful areas of innovation.', 'Market maturation Meeting the worlds sustainability goals will require the procurement of new solutions, particularly in areas like carbon reduction and removal, and water replenishment, at levels many orders of magnitude greater than they exist today.', 'If these markets dont mature rapidly, they will be overwhelmed by the demand that will be placed on them in the coming years.', 'Current sustainability markets, such as those for avoided emissions offsets or carbon removal credits, are opaque and poorly understood by many current customers and most future ones.', 'Standard contracting templates, aggregating demand through buyers alliances, and well communicated pricing and delivery are all advances that will mature these markets and ready them for the onslaught of demand that will occur in the final years of this decade and beyond.', 'By , we must be operating in a world where carbon offset and removal, water replenishment, and ecosystem service markets can supply demand many orders of magnitude greater than today and do so with transactional transparency and standard insurance and indemnification guarantees.', 'Weve seen a tremendous amount of corporate action in the past several years.', 'Yet still only around percent of the worlds largest companies represented by the Global Fortune have pledged to become net zero.', 'By , we need to be operating under a comprehensive and globally coordinated policy regime that limits emissions in line with a .ºC future, and holistically monitors and manages humanity΄s deposits and withdrawals from the natural systems that support our species.', 'We will act in accordance with what we think needs to be done today to create the world we need to be operating in by .', 'When we announced our carbon negative commitment a year ago, we likened it to a moonshot—a grand goal that will require exceptional organizational focus, an integration of innovation from multiple sectors, and a cantfail mentality.', 'If the past months of the COVID pandemic and vaccine development have taught us anything, it is a reminder that the human species is capable of tremendous scientific and technological innovation when faced with a crisis.', 'Our climate crisis may be playing out more slowly than COVID has, but the potential impact on the global economy, livelihoods, and human health is the same—and so, too, must be the scale and speed of our response.', 'We are committed to playing our part and look forward to working with all of you to help accelerate the worlds transition to a more economically and environmentally sustainable future for us all.', 'Overview
