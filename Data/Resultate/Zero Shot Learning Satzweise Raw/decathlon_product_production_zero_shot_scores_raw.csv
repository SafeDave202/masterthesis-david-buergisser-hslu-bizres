OF THE DECLARATION OF EXTRAFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DPEF In line with GRI Global Reporting Initiative G sustainability reporting guidelines, Decathlon applies the following principles when writing its

topics deemed relevant are those that we feel are most important for our own activities and governance • Clarity: to be universally understood • Punctuality: to deliver the report on the same dates every year • Balance: to present a fair idea of the businesss overall performance by reflecting both positive and negative aspects • Accuracy: to give accurate, detailed information to enable readers to gain a better understanding REPORTING SCOPE Decathlon had a presence in distribution countries, with , teammates and a turnover of €.', 'As of , the Decathlon group scope numbered: , stores all sales forms combined warehouses and logistics platforms To establish the CSR target reporting scope for the financial year, it was agreed to use the financial consolidation scope, which comprises all

consolidation scope.', 'L. of the Commercial Code ongoing transactions turnover threshold of .% of total turnover for Decathlon group subsidiaries of the subsidiary being considered Regarding the latter, we consider that the cost of obtaining environmental, social and societal data is disproportionate to the importance they represent.', 'However, any subsidiary with more than stores must be included in the CSR target reporting scope, given their impact on the “Group” data point.', 'any subsidiary registered with the RBU Reporting Business Unit, which corresponds to the turnover relating solely to a production activity for Decathlon products, regardless of the total turnover, must participate in the CSR target reporting scope with regard to the duty of care expressed by the Human

services destined for sports enthusiasts and their families, as well as personal goods generally.', 'Given the above, Decathlon has decided not to discuss actions to combat food waste.', 'Furthermore, these sports nutrition and food supplement products have a long useby date, as they are not particularly perishable.', 'It was also decided not to treat the following topics in the DPEF ; the fight against food insecurity; and responsible, sustainable and fairtrade food choices.', 'These are not significant with regard to the companys main activities and the subjects it has identified as CSR material issues.', 'For the social dimension: This year, in accordance with the action plan implemented by the Sustainable Development Report, the HR reporting project manager appointed in October decided to include three additional countries when gathering social data sourced from payroll software in order to improve the representativeness and reliability of the scope.', 'Turkey, Brazil and the Czech Republic were thus integrated alongside the previous countries France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, China, Poland, Germany, Portugal, Russia, India and Hungary, which increased the scope of social
