'“ We have a multipronged pricing approach which ensures access, including tiered pricing, valuebased agreements and Takedas Patient Assistance Programs, which ensure patients get their entire course of treatment even if they cannot pay for it in full.” Ricardo Marek Leveraging these learnings, the Blueprint project builds on whats already in place, working to strengthen the existing health care

address challenges around access and standard of care.', 'When it comes to solving the problem of providing patients in emerging markets with sustainable access to our highly innovative medicines, we take a personalized and collaborative approach through our PAPs.', 'The patient shares in the cost of treatment according to what they can afford.', 'Takeda and other partners, including local governments, medical associations and NGOs, contribute the rest, thereby ensuring the patient receives their treatment in full.', 'If everyone pays according to their ability to do so, funds can be committed to patients at lower levels of income, and more patients can be reached, resulting in increased access to medicines for patients and financial sustainability.', 'In addition, weve made a significant strategic decision to transition a number of Takeda countries in our Growth Emerging Markets business unit to a model whereby locally generated revenues from our innovative medicines for complex and rare diseases will be reinvested in programs that strengthen the local health care system.', 'The transition will take place over the next few years and include countries that have considerable unmet patient need, and that are fraught with high outofpocket spend, such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Egypt, South Africa and SubSaharan Africa.', 'Aligned with the framework I
