development of the planet.', 'ABB is already contributing towards achieving some of the core goals of the Paris climate conference and the Sustainable Development Goals, and we will do more because they are vital to our future.', 'These global agreements highlight the major environmental and social challenges we face, and provide a clear signpost to the future.', 'Attending the Paris conference, I made it clear that proven technologies and solutions already exist to improve energy efficiency and to enable the scaleup of renewable energy, both of which help to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.', 'ABBs greatest contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been and will be through our energyeffi cient and renewable energy products, systems and services that increase our customers productivity while lowering the impact on the environment.', 'Take energyefficient motors as an example of the difference we can make.', 'CEO letter ABB Sustainability Performance Report ABBs variable speed drives produce energy savings in mo tors of percent with relatively quick payback time, and our installed base saves about terawatthours of electric ity annually or the consumption of million European Union households.', 'This is lowhanging fruit with the technology available now; if supported by the global introduction of common and stringent Minimum Energy Performance Standards, covering the energy efficiency of all products, global energy consumption could be cut by percent, according to a study by the European Commission.', 'Our collaboration over the past year in the United Nations Sus tainable Energy for All initiative where we are inputting ad vice on energyefficient motors and distribution transformers highlights our desire to see lower emissions and new perfor mance standards.', 'On the supply side, ABB is a global leader in supporting the generation and transmission of energy from renewable sources.', 'Renewables form an increasing share of the energy mix and, in some countries, make an important contribution to meeting ambitious carbon reduction targets.', 'But expanding wind and solar power generation capacity is not sufficient on its own.', 'To ensure the reliability of energy supply, the growth of renewable generation must go handin hand with investment in technology to integrate their valu able, but intermittent, output into the grid.', 'ABB has continued to make advances in the highvoltage di rect current technology we pioneered years ago so that massive amounts of clean energy produced by solar, wind or hydro generation can be transmitted over long distances with minimal losses.', 'The ability to ensure reliable integration of renewables into the grid was reflected in key orders in .', 'In China, for ex ample, we won orders for two ultrahighvoltage links, both able to transmit , megawatts of wind and solar power, which will meet the electricity needs of million people.', 'And in India, we energized the first phase of an electricity “superhighway” supplying clean hydroelectric power from the Himalayas to Agra, which will serve some million people.', 'We also see opportunities for greater deployment of lowcar bon microgrids to bring clean energy generated by solar or wind to millions of people in remote communities, particu larly in Africa and South Asia, who have no access to electric ity.', 'We know from our existing projects how distributed en ergy solutions can lead at the community level to economic progress, improvements to health and education, and better management of the local environment.', 'The deployment of such technologies support the aims both of the Paris Agreement and of some core elements of the Sustainable Development Goals.', 'For example,

linked.', 'The success of one is unthinkable without the other.', 'Within ABB I often speak of the need to work and move for ward together.', 'The international agreements reached this year, as well as the crises we have faced around the globe, have highlighted the need for broader, innovative thinking and col laboration to meet the increasing challenges to society and our environment.', 'Ulrich Spiesshofer CEO ABB Sustainability Performance Report CEO letter Introduction Progress and challenges The most frequent questions we receive from our stakehold ers are: How is ABB contributing to a better world?', 'How is the company advancing towards achieving its Group Sustain ability Objectives and what are the main chal lenges we face?', 'In brief, our contributions to mitigating climate change and enhancing societal progress take different forms; advances were made in several areas in in implementing our objectives, and we continued to face a number of diverse challenges.', 'Our nine Groupwide sustainability objectives are designed to ensure we reach our goal by of being recognized as a leading contributor to a more sustainable world through our business offering and sustainable business practices.', 'The objectives cover areas such as our products, systems and ser vices, climate change, resource efficiency, integrity, sourcing, safety and security, and our role as an employer and in society.', 'All of these issues have a direct or indirect impact on ABBs business success, and considerable work is ongoing to set and reach targets as we head towards .', 'Our stakeholders, internal and external, reaffirmed in that the goals we have set ourselves are the right ones and material to ABBs business, while offering additional advice on the challenges we face.', 'How we contribute The objectives acknowledge that we can contribute further to improving the environmental and social conditions in which we live.', 'Our prime contribution towards mitigating climate change is to provide our customers with energyefficient products, systems and solutions which lower energy consumption and cut emissions.', 'However, the benefits do not stop with the customer they translate into wider benefits for society.', 'When fully commissioned in , the link will be capable of transmitting enough electricity to serve around million peo ple, based on average national consumption.', 'A reliable energy supply leads to economic growth, and improved social services in health care, education and housing.', 'Our commitment to research and development, with spending of .', 'billion percent of revenues in , strengthens our ability to deliver energyefficient technology to such projects and meet the needs of a rapidly changing world.', 'We contribute to societal progress in different ways: through the wealth and jobs we create, the taxes we pay governments, our presence in communities where we stimulate trade and employment, through the way in which we work with and train stakeholders such as suppliers and employees, and through our community programs and projects which target improve ments to education and health.', 'Our sustainability objectives highlighting responsible sourcing, safe and secure operations, and strengthening our role in the community, underpin these contributions to social progress.', 'In the objective related to expanding revenues from our “eco efficient” portfolio of products, systems and solutions, revenues in remained around percent of total earnings.', 'As far as our own performance is concerned, absolute energy consumption has now dropped by .', 'There was a further percent reduction in water with drawals and a total of percent of waste was sent for final disposal.', 'We strive for zero incidents throughout our opera tions.', 'In , employees completed , site observation tours to improve safety compliance in offices, factories and customers sites on track to meet the target of , such tours.', 'Despite the incidents which still occur, there was an underly ing improvement in most safety performance areas in .', 'The number of serious injuries dropped by percent com pared to , the total recordable incident frequency rate was down by percent; and the lost time incident frequency Progress and challenges ABB Sustainability Performance Report rate was down from .', 'As part of the drive to strengthen our safety culture, perfor mance against leading indicators, including the reporting of hazards and the number of site observation tours, are not only part of the Group sustainability objectives but also fea ture in the Group scorecard which determines bonus levels.', 'Safety and integrity are the leading value pair within ABB, and further progress was also reported in integrity training and communication.', 'We have also stepped up efforts to meet our supply chain tar get of ensuring we understand and manage environmental and social risks in our global sourcing operations.', 'The Supplier Sustainability Development Program to assess and train sup pliers and build assessment capacity in ABB expanded further in .', 'The scope of the program was extended in southeast Asia and eastern Europe, and further risks were assessed and mitigated.', 'More detail on our performance and programs, as well as our approach to the sustainability agenda, can be accessed throughout this report.', 'Key measures such as a divisional realign ment and the reduction of five divisions to four, took effect at the start of with the aim of delivering additional customer value from our unique power and automation offering.', 'We face other challenges: how to ensure the safety and secu rity of our people in an increasingly volatile world.', 'To consoli date the safety improvements made in , we are seeking to strengthen business line manager responsibility and ac countability, carry out further widespread training and improve the auditing of sites; similarly, additional security assessments and training are also of paramount importance.', 'While considerable work continues on managing environmental and social risks at our suppliers, we face an obvious challenge of scale since we have some , direct material and proj ect service suppliers.', 'This is why the focus of our Supplier Sustainability Development Program has been on potentially highrisk suppliers in highrisk countries.', 'We have not seen incidents of child or forced labor in recent years or other egregious forms of human rights abuse.', 'But, as the chapter in this report on Responsible Sourcing shows, there are many other areas of noncompliance with national law andor the standards we set out in the ABB Supplier Code of Conduct.', 'There are other areas where we are seeking to improve re sults: the objective to decrease energy intensity per dollar of sales by percent by will see further efforts to drive energy efficiency at our own sites; our work to increase under standing and management of human rights risks has been ongoing for several years well before the adoption of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Hu man Rights but can be stepped up; and we will make further efforts to reduce water consumption and waste sent for final disposal from our sites.', 'For example, to free up more time for direct engagement with stakeholders such as inves tors, we chose not to participate in the Dow Jones Sustain ability Index questionnaire in , having been ranked as an industry leader for of the past years.', 'These efforts are ongoing, and they are being complemented by programs to increase diversity, which focus primarily on gender issues, and ensure that we retain our ability to attract, develop and retain Overall, ABB remains committed to delivering on all of our Group sustainability objectives by .', 'The objectives are aligned with the goals of our corporate Next Level strategy, and are part of our ability to deliver sustainable business success and
