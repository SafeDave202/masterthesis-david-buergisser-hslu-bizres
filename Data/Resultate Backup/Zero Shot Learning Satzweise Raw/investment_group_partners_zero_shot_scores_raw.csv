GRI Content Index Contacts A NOTE FROM THE CHAIRMAN A note from the Chairman Steffen Meister Executive Chairman was a pivotal year for Partners Group.', 'It started with a moment of introspection and reflection as we took stock of what has made us successful following years of strong growth, what may be slowing us down, and what we need to build up as we continue to grow.', ""It ended with the definition of a clear roadmap for the next phase of our firm's sustainable development and several associated action items that we believe will enable us to achieve true impact for our stakeholders now and in the future."", 'The roadmap we have defined follows two key themes: ""own the business"" and ""care for people.""', 'Owning the business refers to both our own operations and to our global portfolio of businesses and assets spanning multiple industries.', 'That is why we remain more convinced than ever about our entrepreneurial governance approach, which focuses on building and managing highperforming boards for our portfolio companies and working together with them on targeted value creation initiatives that enable longterm, sustainable growth.', 'Partners Group At the same time, we want to ensure that our own firm continues to be managed in a principled and effective manner, especially as we continue to grow.', 'In , we initiated a series of significant measures to improve our organizational effectiveness, including the launch of our new ""Cell Leadership"" structure.', 'The objective of the structure is to give back ownership of daytoday business decisions and processes to individual teams or ""cells,"" which are typically made up of five to ten people and headed by a Cell Leader.', 'This ensures that organizational decisions are made at the right level and empowers our many investment, client and services team leaders to truly own their business area.', 'We also established a program of ""Operational Excellence,"" built around a set of principles, to safeguard our business and strengthen our dayto day operations and services.', 'Caring for people was our other major area of focus in .', ""In addition to being responsible owners of businesses, we also want to be a responsible employer for our more than , employees worldwide and our portfolio companies' close to , combined employees."", 'Within our investments, caring for portfolio company employees also continued to be high on our environmental, social and governance ESG engagement agenda in .', 'Examples of ESG value creation initiatives focused on serving our portfolio company employees include creating a hardship fund for employees of US restaurant chain Pacific Bells, establishing a Driver Safety Program for employees of utility locating business USIC, and providing access to an Employee Assistance Programme for employees facing mental health challenges at Civica, a UKbased provider of software and outsourcing services.', ""The new program will consider systematically reinvesting a portion of achieved value creation at exit for the benefit of our portfolio companies' employees and other stakeholders."", ""Taking a step back and looking at the broader economy, one of the sustainability topics that has quickly risen up the global community's agenda to become one of the most pressing issues of our time is climate change."", 'In this report, you will read about the Climate Change Strategy we are developing to formalize our approach to managing climate risks and impacts across our investment portfolio and our firm.', 'While we are proud of the steps we have taken to further integrate climate change considerations into our investment processes and operations, we acknowledge that this is only the beginning of the journey and that effectively tackling this complex issue will be an ongoing, multiyear effort.', 'A NOTE FROM THE CHAIRMAN As always, we remain committed to reporting our sustainability priorities in a transparent manner and to maintaining an

continued strong growth, we have found that leadership development, organizational effectiveness and cultural aspects have at times taken second place to more immediate business needs."", 'The firm spent the entirety of inhouse at Partners Group and together with a broad, internal working group comprising members of our Board and Executive Committee, and leaders from across our business units explored what has made us successful in the past, what may be slowing us down today, and what we need to build up in the future to ensure continued growth.', 'We believe this approach empowers our

Operating Officer General Counsel Partners Group FOCUS TOPIC Partners Group professionals attending one of our nextgeneration leadership training programs focused on fostering ownership excellence.', 'Partners Group SPECIAL TOPIC Special topic: climate change Defining our strategy on climate change Sourcing The development of a platformwide Climate Change Strategy was a highly relevant corporate sustainability milestone for Partners Group in .', ""This strategy defines Partners Group's approach to managing climate risks and impacts across our company and our portfolio."", 'While addressing climate change requires action from governments, civil society and businesses, we believe that investors are uniquely positioned to catalyze the transition to a lowcarbon economy through the systematic assessment and management of climate risks and opportunities.', 'At Partners Group, we are committed to managing those risks for our company and our global portfolio of investments.', 'As a responsible investor, we have been assessing and managing the climaterelated risks and opportunities of our investments for years.', 'With the emergence of the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures TCFD in , we saw a clear framework to organize our climaterelated activities and formalize the governance structure around them.', 'Concurrently, we have used the frameworks of the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment UNPRI and the CDP formerly Carbon Disclosure Project to identify areas where we could take further action to enhance the climate resilience of our investments.', 'The chart below demonstrates the evolution of our approach to climate change, culminating in the development of our Climate Change Strategy in , which we plan to launch publicly by the end of as a standalone document.', 'Responsible Investment Policy ESG risk assessment and management including climate risks Impact Strategy Climate Change Strategy Promotion of targeted lowcarbon investments through our impact atscale strategy Development of an organizationwide Climate Change Strategy Our approach to climate change aligns with the four core elements of TCFD: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.', 'We have embedded this approach into the key stages of our investment and ownership process from sourcing and due diligence through ownership to exit.', 'These stages encompass our Climate Change Strategy for our investment portfolio.', 'Partners Group Over the years, we have developed a set of guidelines to help us approach ESG sensitivities in fossil fuelsrelated investments at the sourcing and screening stage.', 'Overall, we do not invest on behalf of our clients in companies or assets whose main business is the exploration or direct extraction or production of fossil fuel, regardless of their origin or use.', 'In addition, we extend exclusion to: • • • • • assets that would not exist if their main product or service did not support coal extraction, transportation, or use for energy generation; service providers to the coal industry that generate more than % of their revenue from thermal coal and have no plans to reduce this percentage over time; service providers for the shale oil and gas industry, such as drilling rig operators, frac sand suppliers, and oilfield service providers; treatment and logistics services for tar sands and heavy oil; deforestation or the burning of vast natural ecosystems for the purpose of land clearance.', 'We regard gas pipelines, treatment facilities and gaspowered plants as supportive of the transition to cleaner sources of energy, as it is more sustainable to convert coal power plants to gas power plants and decrease overall GHG emissions, especially when they play a key role in providing baseload power and grid balancing.', 'We are also actively targeting low carbon and climateresilient investments, with a heavy focus on renewable energy development.', 'Due diligence We have updated our internal ESG Due Diligence Assessment to ensure early identification of climate risks by our investment teams.', 'In addition, we now require external ESG due diligence providers to include a section dedicated to climaterelated risks and opportunities in their final deliverables for all lead direct private equity and private infrastructure investments.', 'This allows us to have a clear sense of risks, impact mitigation and value creation opportunities related to climate change for all potential lead investments.', ""Ownership We have made significant efforts to more accurately measure our portfolio's emissions."", 'This year, we completed a GHG foot printing exercise for our portfolio of direct lead investments to help us identify where our greatest risks and opportunities lie.', 'Through this exercise, we identified and prioritized key actions SPECIAL TOPIC Sourcing Due diligence Ownership Exit Screening Framework: • Carbon exclusion list • Climatesensitivity materiality screening based on subindustry classification framework ESG Due Diligence Assessment: • Assess climate risk against predefined questions integrated in our assessment tool • For lead investments, include climate risk in thirdparty due diligence Engagement and monitoring: • Implement climate engagement projectssweeps • Offer GHG emissions energy efficiency reduction toolkit • Monitor climate risk mitigationadaptation performance through annual ESG KPI survey Engagement summaries: • Highlight climate engagements in seller materials through case studies and climate metrics • Identify and meet climaterelated market requirements e.g.', 'mandatory climate disclosures for listed companies to take over the coming years, including: • • • increasing data quality and tracking capabilities for companies that are unable to accurately report on their GHG footprint; developing and implementing companyspecific actions, such as energy efficiency or fuel reduction initiatives and physical climate risk assessments and mitigation strategies; building out a climate change ""sweep"" for our portfolio to ensure a systematic approach to improving our companies\' performance on this topic during ownership; • monitoring climate riskimpact mitigation performance for all lead investments annually through our ESG KPI survey; • reporting progress publicly through our ESG Dashboards.', ""Exit The goal of our efforts is to demonstrate a material improvement in our portfolio companies' climate risk and impact mitigation performance over the lifetime of our investments."", 'The steps outlined during sourcing, due diligence, and ownership will allow us to highlight climaterelated improvements in seller materials and meet climaterelated market requirements, such as mandatory climate disclosures for listed companies, by the time we seek to exit.', 'In carrying out the early stages of our Climate Change Strategy for our portfolio, we are humbled by the tremendous task facing us and the industry, but we are also excited to explore the climate opportunities that might gradually change the way we invest in and build our businesses.', 'We look forward to reporting on the success of the measures we have taken and the impact they have on our portfolio in the years to come.', 'Lead by example In addition to addressing climaterelated risks and impacts at our portfolio companies, we are committed to addressing our own corporate impact and leading our portfolio companies by example.', 'Despite the relatively low carbonintensive nature of our industry, we nevertheless want to make a fair contribution to reducing our GHG footprint and consider our firm, as well as all individual employees, directly responsible for protecting our environment.', 'At corporate level, we recognize that business travel is by far our greatest source of GHG emissions.', 'The aim of any business trip is to ensure we stay close to our clients, source new investment opportunities and work with our portfolio companies on ESG engagements and value creation initiatives all to build better assets for our stakeholders.', 'However, we are committed to reducing our impact and, as a first step, we are fully offsetting our CO emissions from corporate air travel.', 'To achieve this, we have teamed up with Natural Capital Partners, a leading expert on carbon neutrality and climate finance.', 'Together, we have built a global portfolio of low carbon sustainable development projects that we are financing in order to offset our CO emissions according to the highest international standards.', 'In , we offset close to , metric tons of COe generated by our global air travel activities throughout the year.', 'Today, our compensation portfolio comprises a mix of global afforestation, reforestation, forest protection and water infrastructure projects.', 'Over time, we will also explore other CO compensation options, such as sponsoring and collaborating with other leading organizations on research projects and finding additional entrepreneurial projects that have a high CO compensation multiplier.', 'In addition to offsetting our emissions from corporate air travel, we also encourage all employees to travel in an efficient manner and avoid unnecessary trips through our Travel Policy.', 'We also continue to invest in installing video conferencing systems in all our offices globally to support the reduction of business travel between offices.', 'Partners Group SPECIAL TOPIC Examples of projects included in our offsetting portfolio are shown below: Acre Amazonian Rainforest Conservation, Brazil Project type: agricultural, forestry and landscapes Region: Latin America Standards: VCS, CBBGold Description The project prevents deforestation in , hectares of pristine rainforest in western Acre state, Brazil, home to the Amazon basin and some of the worlds most biodiverse habitats.', 'The project works with communities and local groups and uses carbon revenues to help protect ecosystem services.', 'Around communities live inside the project area, all in close proximity to the northern banks of the Valparaiso River, a major tributary of the Amazon that provides critical ecosystem services.', 'Sustainable Development Goals supported In addition to delivering approximately , tonnes of emissions reductions each year to tackle climate action, the project delivers a number of other sustainable development benefits.', 'These include: • Life on Land: a key part of the project is the land owners working with the families to give them formal rights to individual parcels of land in return for assistance in preventing deforestation.', ""• Zero Hunger: the local farmers' association is being supported through the project to help build a local crop processing plant, and new equipment to increase the productivity of the land."", 'Find out more about the project here: naturalcapitalpartners.comprojectsprojectacreamazonianrainforestconservation Partners Group SPECIAL TOPIC • Gender Equality: boreholes greatly reduce the time needed to collect water and fuel, and purify water, which are typically tasks handled by women.', 'On collection alone, the boreholes reduced the time spent daily on this activity by over %.', 'Improved water infrastructure, SubSaharan Africa Project type: water Region: SubSaharan Africa Standard: Gold Standard Description It is estimated that at least two billion people worldwide do not have access to safely managed drinking water.', 'This Gold Standard project provides clean drinking water to small rural communities in SubSaharan Africa by repairing and drilling new boreholes.', 'Boreholes can be used as water wells by installing a vertical pipe casing and well screen, which allows water to be extracted from the ground, even during dry seasons.', 'By providing clean water, communities no longer need to purify water through boiling.', 'This alleviates pressure on local forests the predominant source of firewood and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.', 'Sustainable Development Goals supported In addition to delivering approximately , tonnes of emissions reductions each year, the project delivers a number of other benefits, including: • Good Health and Wellbeing: in Uganda, ten rehabilitated boreholes serve , people, preventing cases of diarrhea and six fatalities each year.', '• Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure: locally appropriate technology is used, such as Afridev hand pumps, maintained by local mechanics trained under the project to maintain a longterm solution.', '• Climate Action: the rehabilitated boreholes provide the communities with access to clean ground water, making them less susceptible to severe droughts.', 'Find out more about the project here: naturalcapitalpartners.comprojectsprojectsubsaharanafricaimprovedwaterinfrastructure Partners Group SPECIAL TOPIC QA on climate change with Carmela Mondino and Mátyás Csiky Mátyás Csiky Global Head PG Impact Verein and Carmela Mondino ESG Sustainability What climate impacts are most material from a corporate and investment perspective?', 'Carmela: From an investment perspective, climate change definitely presents a number of material risks and potential impacts.', 'These include policy developments such as carbon taxes, which could increase the cost of operations across our portfolio, or physical risks such as floods and wildfires, which can cause serious damage to businesses and communities, as is evident from the wildfires in Australia this year.', 'Mátyás: From our own corporate perspective, the climate impacts we deal with are fewer compared to those we see across our global portfolio of businesses and assets.', 'As an investment manager, we do not produce physical goods or have long supply chains.', 'Our direct environmental impact is mainly generated through our office buildings and through business travel, particularly air travel.', 'Just as we assess material impacts across our portfolio, we also discuss the impact of our own operations on a regular basis in order to find ways to reduce it.', 'Since air travel is currently our most significant source of GHG emissions, it is the first issue we have decided to tackle.', 'How do you incorporate climate change risks and opportunities into the investment process?', 'Carmela: Through the platformwide Climate Change Strategy we are developing, we have established action items for each step in the investment lifecycle.', 'We also have a climate change sensitivity assessment, which helps us identify particularly carbonintensive businesses or assets.', 'At the same time, just as we are excluding certain types of investments, we are also overweighting others that help tackle climate change, such as investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency.', 'We have also incorporated climate change criteria into our ESG Due Diligence Assessment so that our investment teams can identify potential climate change risks or areas that require further engagement with a target asset on our part.', 'Within our existing portfolio of companies and assets, we have started to assess our carbon footprint.', ""If you look at our ESG Dashboards on pages , and , you will see a new column showing each asset's estimated carbon footprint."", 'We acknowledge that we are still not able to gather this information for every single asset, but we are setting a baseline so that we can start acting on it.', 'Mátyás: While on the traditional investment side it has been easier to identify opportunities that support the environment, when it comes to our philanthropic activities through PG Impact, our employee foundation, it is harder to find projects that have a pure climate action focus.', 'Many of the foundations we come across focus on social impact and might lead to environmental benefits as a byproduct.', 'The market is not that mature yet, but I think this will change in the near future as climate change becomes an increasingly pressing global issue.', 'What is Partners Group doing to address climate change at both the corporate and portfolio level?', 'Mátyás: As a firm, we have committed to fully offsetting our annual corporate air travel emissions as a first step towards reducing our impact on the environment.', 'In , we teamed up with Natural Capital Partners to offset these emissions by building and financing a globally diversified portfolio of low carbon sustainable development projects.', 'These include forest protection and reforestations projects, as well as water Partners Group SPECIAL TOPIC infrastructure projects that also have a social component to them.', 'For example, one of the projects we are financing helps provide clean drinking water to rural communities in Sub Saharan Africa while protecting local forests.', 'Carmela: On an investment portfolio level, our environmental impact is less related to travel and more related to energy consumption.', 'That is why most of our environmental engagements with portfolio companies focus on reducing energy consumption and increasing energy efficiency.', 'These engagements can generate significant energy savings.', 'For example, if a company has never implemented any energy efficiency measures, it has the potential to save over % of its energy consumption through relatively simple initiatives.', ""And the great thing about these initiatives is that they are not only good for the environment, but also have a positive impact on our portfolio companies' bottom line."", 'With our portfolio company KinderCare, a provider of early childhood education in the US, we did just that.', 'By installing remote control systems that allow lights and air conditioning systems to be switched off remotely when areas are not in use, we saved over .', 'million kWh in energy consumption, equivalent to more than four tons of CO and USD , in annual savings.', 'Through these sweeps, we have been able to develop a standardized toolkit for energy and fuel management that we apply across our portfolio.', 'Building out a climate change sweep will be a focus area for us in .', '""If a company has never implemented any energy efficiency measures, it has the potential to save over % of its energy consumption through relatively simple initiatives.""', 'What are the main climaterelated challenges and opportunities for Partners Group going forward?', 'Mátyás: From a corporate perspective, an important challenge will be aligning our environmental objectives with the growth of our business.', 'As we continue to grow and increase the number of our employees, clients and assets under management, we will also inevitably see an increase in our emissions.', 'While our emissions will grow, the goal is to keep their growth to a minimum by encouraging employees to travel in an efficient manner and avoid unnecessary trips.', 'Through our action on climate change, we can help educate our employees and other stakeholders on this critical topic and hope that this trickles into their private lives.', 'It is the beginning of the journey not just for Partners Group but for other investment managers.', 'As we undertake this journey, we will continuously improve our response to the challenges posed by climate change, but we believe it is critically important to start acting today.', 'Carmela: On the investment side, I see a couple of specific challenges.', 'First, there is the difficulty of collecting emissions data from our portfolio companies.', 'We find that, at entry, many of the companies we invest in have never measured their carbon footprint, which makes it harder to get initiatives up and running.', 'This refers to the ability to model the potential impact of climate change on a business.', 'While we always aim to quantify the ESG impact of our portfolio as much as possible, it is hard to come by accurate climate change figures we can incorporate into our models.', 'However, there are also lots of investment opportunities that address the impacts of climate change.', 'Our investment on behalf of our clients in Techem, a leading European energy efficiency business, is one great example.', 'The company contributes to global climate protection objectives by installing and maintaining submetering devices in properties which allow for more efficient energy use and significant energy savings.', 'Another example is our portfolio of investments in renewable energy infrastructure, which currently totals .GW in generation capacity.', 'Finally, for an investment manager, focusing on climate change risks and opportunities can also be a differentiating factor.', 'Our industry is not as mature as others when it comes to addressing climate change, and this gives us an opportunity to be a leader in this space.', 'Partners Group MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

approach combined with continuous ESG engagements at the assets, we have accumulated valuable subject area expertise as well as project execution skills, which enable us to systematically improve in these areas across our lead direct portfolio.', 'The two portfolio sweeps we conducted in focused on health safety and fraud, bribery corruption.', 'We aim to operate our companies in the top quartile of health safety standards, establish best practices, and improve our oversight of health safety performance, including that of contractors and subcontractors.', 'For the fraud sweep, we went through a similar process to not only update our existing methodology used to understand fraud risks within our portfolio, but also define our vision for a robust fraud risk management system and establish the infrastructure around it accordingly.', 'Partners Group PROGRESS REPORT Responsible investment Governance risk Financial performance Human capital Business ethics Environment The lifecycle of a

For both the health safety and fraud portfolio sweeps, we started with a robust risk triaging exercise, identifying the high, medium and low risk assets within our portfolio to aid prioritization.', 'Throughout the sweeps, especially as findings and learnings came in, we continuously updated our risk triaging methodology, keeping in mind that the goal was to establish a robust system on ESG issues throughout our investment and ownership lifecycle, for both existing and new investments.', 'We incorporated questions on health safety, fraud, bribery and corruption, as well as climate

assessment, including criteria such as industry, revenue makeup and the ranking of the investment's headquarters' home jurisdiction on the Corruption Perceptions Index CPI."", 'This risk triaging strengthens our understanding of potential risks in our portfolio and informs priority targets for the sweeps to be conducted postclosing.', 'ESG integration by asset class in While our Responsible Investment Policy and Methodology gives us overarching guidelines, we also think about ESG from an asset class and sector perspective.', 'This is how we look at each of our asset classes: Private equity For private equity, we have developed an integrated approach to ESG at each stage of the investment lifecycle, from due diligence through ownership to exit.', 'We have embedded this systematic approach in the practices of our investment and Industry Value Creation teams.', ""When looking at a Partners Group potential direct investment, our investment teams are responsible for completing this standardized inhouse ESG Due Diligence Assessment, which identifies material ESG factors based on a company's industry and subindustry."", 'Using a stoplight approach, the investment team
