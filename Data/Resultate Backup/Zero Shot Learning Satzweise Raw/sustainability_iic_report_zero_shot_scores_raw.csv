flip flops which we have used in our leftover campaign.', 'The whole initiative was a great example of how support and sustainability can go hand in hand, and how unprecedented and critical situations such as COVID can be used to create something new, help limit the negative impact to the environment as well as society.', 'IIC Sustainability Report Chemical management As chemical management is one of the top priorities in terms of materiality topics for IIC and our stakeholders, we fully comply with the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals REACH regulation of the EU.', 'We therefore do not use any restricted chemical as defined under REACH.', 'Many countries within the European Union have different stricter restrictions and guidelines on specific chemicals.', 'Due to IICs internal policy of the ‘strictest rule applies all products comply with the strictest guidelines.', 'This means that we follow the highest chemical compliance requirements often going far beyond what individual national regulations require.', 'Our EBs are not only following the minimum regulations, but are also trying to reduce the use of chemicals in general.', 'All products with the exclusion of tents that require a durable water repellent are now PFC free and many products have an ecological or biobased finish.', 'CHALLENGES AND WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE One of the biggest challenges in was mass implementation of the BEPI system for suppliers and their factories, still ongoing today as this implementation is on voluntary basis.', 'Another challenge is that the tracking of progress of the production sites turns out to be difficult, as evolutionary data is not available.', 'Ultimately, this lack of data makes it very hard to analyse our environmental performance.', 'Another challenge in was the reduction of the logistic capacity of big shipping companies.', 'Due to the reduction, the prices of shipping almost quadrupled and discussions around green logistic solutions and the use of biodiesel were none starters.', 'Looking ahead, we view the road and rail initiative along the historic silk road as a positive development for our logistical ecological footprint and one that will lead to possible shorter lead times.', 'Although using road and rail freight is far better for the environment than airfreight, it is not lower than current shipping practices which is IICs primary shipment method to transport goods.', 'IIC Sustainability Report OUR PRODUCTS When it comes to sustainability in our products, the first things many people think of is recycling.', 'We at IIC are well aware that sustainability starts at the very top.', 'We start to rethink our products and packaging already from the beginning at the designing process.', 'We aim towards reduction of materials, chemicals, water consumption, CO emissions and more along our supply chain and finally recycle and reuse materials at the end.', 'We are continuously working on how we can improve sustainability in our products and are working closely with all our stakeholders.', 'In , we created two new positions: First the “Material Manager” to have a better focus on the use of materials and fabrics in our products.', 'The second was that of an Innovation and Sustainability Manager for Exclusive Brands who is ultimately responsible for the EB product sustainability strategy and roadmap.', 'This year, we also concluded a lot of research on possible material strategies and identified what we meant by “a sustainable product”.', 'For us, a product can be deemed sustainable if the main component of a product contains at least % eco friendly composition or if a product is produced with sustainable technologies and processes.', 'The Green Series was also a year of positioning and developing the sustainability strategy for EB products and setting new standards and requirements for our EBs products.', 'The new sustainable standards and labels will be applied to the new Green Series range of products as of season SpringSummer .', 'Our GRI Green Series strategy is material led and will follow the principles of the three Rs: Reduce: chemicals, CO, water and the use of virgin plastic Recycle: Materials and waste Rethink: Natural content, eco design, production processes IIC Sustainability Report SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS The whole process of designing and choosing materials used in our products has a huge impact on our environmental performance.', 'We are constantly working on the improvements of our materials and are in close contact with manufacturers of sustainable raw materials.', 'Odor Crunch provides odor control for garments through the use of one of the worlds most plentiful and natural resources, sand silica.', 'This technology addresses odor in garments so that they do not need to be washed as often which reduces water, energy consumption, as well as limiting the release of microplastics and washing detergents.', 'The technology coming from Polygiene

Polylactic Acid This material biobased, easily recyclable and made from renewable resources.', 'With the right temperature and humidity conditions it is also biodegradable.', 'is WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE We at IIC are only in control of the materials used by our EBs.', 'We are continuously benchmarking ourselves with other players in the sporting goods industry and trying to adapt best practices.', 'Nevertheless, we are well aware that we should set clear KPIs in the use of sustainable materials.', 'Measurable objectives, in terms of sustainability, allow us to keep track of the progress we make.', 'IIC Sustainability Report PROCESSES A sustainable product is not only defined by its materials, but also by its production processes.', 'At IIC, we are following several standards and certifications to meet the increased demand of society towards more responsible and sustainable business operations.', 'Therefore, we do our best to make sure that our EBs follow ecofriendly processes to reduce our environmental footprint.', 'PFCFree Durable Water Repellents DWRs PFCs are completely artificial chemicals commonly used in durable water repellent DWR for coatings and waterproof

risks to people.', 'Additionally, the process uses less water and energy, and therefore CO emissions are reduced.', 'footprint and WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE One of the challenges in was the restriction of travelling and meeting people.', 'This helps us to decrease the number of physical samples needed and simplify the sampling process, but also saves business trips, photo shoots and therefore costs and emissions.', 'As we started the pilot in , we will continue in and try to onboard and support our suppliers to use this new technology.', 'IIC Sustainability Report PACKAGING Packaging is playing a big role in the retail industry.', 'Not only the packaging for the endconsumer, but also the packaging along the supply chain needs to be addressed.', 'was a turning point for IIC and developing sustainable packaging specification is part of our sustainability strategy now.', 'IIC has steadily increased the share of recycled materials and biodegradable plastics used, as well as reduced the amount of plastic overall in our packaging.', 'In , we worked on the reduction of the use of WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE In the future, the main challenge for IIC is to have proper packaging specifications and to track these, which is still lacking today.', 'Once this is well implemented, it will be easier to link the packaging agenda with the IIC sustainability agenda of following the three Rs.', 'The mix of plastic and paper plastic in our EB packaging and in we will have some collections without any plastic use in the packaging at all.', 'Our packaging is often paper based and sourced from sustainably managed forests andor from recycled plastic.', 'For instance, with our EB PRO TOUCH, we were able to save .', 'tons of plastic by moving to paperbased packaging for some products.', 'We also banned the use of all polybags for samples.', 'makes the whole recycling stream complicated.', 'One step IIC has taken, is to move away from plastic tape and using paper tape for the EBs export packaging.', 'IIC Sustainability Report PLASTIC FREE EXCLUSIVE BRANDS This year, IIC has updated two of the EBs packaging designs, for energetics and McKINLEY aiming for a new positioning of the brands and the products.', 'We have successfully switched out all plastic packaging components for swim caps and swim goggles of the energetics brand for cardboard packaging, and thus saved a total of .', 'With the same initiative, we also succeeded in saving kg of plastic packaging in our PRO TOUCH brand by changing the previous clamshell packaging to cardboard boxes.', 'Additionally, we worked hard to have the box kit with recycled paper sourced from sustainably managed forests.', 'There is a strong incentive for the EB team to work on their assets in terms of sustainability, defining the material strategies, look and feel of the packaging, and researching the potential substitutes and The Packaging department has a lot of freedom which gives space for improvement, and could become one of the main sustainability focuses for IIC.', 'Florent Deligny, Packaging Developer Footwear and Hardware Development .', 'kg of plasticpackaging saving alternatives; which is a long but essential

Report RENTAL SERVICES Although COVID has hit the winter sports season, especially in terms of ski equipment, we can still see an ongoing demand and growth of the whole rental business.', 'The sharing economy is growing stronger year on year.', 'This year we added the category winter apparel to our offered product range of skis, ski boots and bindings, poles, helmets, gloves, boards, sledges, ice skates and for the summer included climbing and bike as well as bike equipments.', 'We are running several campaigns to promote our rental business and make the consumer more aware of sustainability perks of rental services.', 'The rental service at IIC plays a big sustainable asset for our sustainability strategy.', 'By offering rental services we allow customers to engage in more diverse sports experiences, to try new activities and promote circular and shared consumption, which does not always have to be based on ownership principles.', 'This allows our customers to travel more comfortably without carrying bulky sports equipment, hence allowing an ecofriendlier and less CO emitting way of moving.', 'Sharing equipment means fewer resources are used in the production of products.', 'We pay attention to the care, repair and upkeep of the products ensuring that all rental products are always fit for purpose for every use.', 'We also take over responsibility of the end of life of the products either through recycling or resale.', 'Our winter sports business has been the primary focus of our rental activities and is part of our groups heritage, its been around for over years.', 'IIC Sustainability Report RETAIL The retailers with all their sales and stores are playing an important role for IIC.', 'We try to work closely together with the National Organisations and retailers, to motivate and incentivise and align everyone on one common goal.', 'We act as consultants by offering suggestions to the local retailers in terms of sustainability improvements.', 'Together with our retailers, we are trying to eliminate the use of plastic bags by introducing paper bags.', 'Additionally, the organisational structure of IIC and the independence of retailers allows them to run their own initiatives, for example actions to reduce their energy consumption.', 'This is not only good for the environment, but also helps them from a financial perspective to reduce their costs.', 'WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE Although the organisational structure of IIC does not allow us to directly push for sustainability improvements, we still believe that we can inspire our network of retailers to implement certain changes and promote knowledgesharing among them.', 'Therefore, it is sometimes hard to implement and promote sustainable topics.', 'We continuously strive to find solutions that can generally be implemented and be scaled among our retail network, as local solutions are often too specific and cannot be applied for all retailers in different cultural and market settings.', 'Moreover, we see a big potential in take back and repair services, which are also in the responsibility of the local retailers.', 'Therefore, the opportunity for IIC will be to showcase the huge potential of repairing products, so that end consumers will have access to other more sustainable consumption patterns wherever they go.', 'IIC Sustainability Report SUSTAINABILITY IN OUR OFFICES Not only do our suppliers and Exclusive Brands, but also our own headquarters in Bern, contribute to our environmental performance.', 'We monitor the water use, energy and electricity consumption, waste generation and keep track of our business travels.', 'As this was the case for the majority of businesses in due to COVID, there were fewer employees in the office that used our sport facilities and showers.', 'This has meant not only a greater flexibility for our employees, but also a chance for us to reduce our environmental footprint.', 'Energy use At IIC headquarters, there are several systems combined to optimize our energy use and oil consumption.', 'The heating of our office space and warm water is supported by our heat pump, which has covered .% of our energy use without electricity in .', 'In order to store energy, our headquarters are equipped with heat and cold storage units.', 'This allows us to improve our energy loss efficiency.', 'The electricity we use for lighting, and our IT services and infrastructure come from % renewable energy.', 'We also aim to further improve our energy efficiency and are therefore monitoring our consumption of electricity with smart meters.', 'GRI , , Water use As water is a scarce resource, we believe that it should be handled responsibly also in our offices.', 'Therefore, we are engaged in creating awareness about cold and warm water consumption not only for our suppliers, but also for our employees in our headquarters.', 'Therefore, the main water use can be traced back to the showers.', 'Nevertheless, we are working on the reduction of the water use and all showers are equipped with water saving shower heads.', 'Waste and recycling Due to adverse impacts of uncontrolled waste disposal on the natural environments, we strive to avoid, reduce and recycle waste not only along our supply chain, but also at our offices.', 'Therefore, the important first step is to assess the waste generation and disposal in all daily operations.', 'Moreover, at our headquarters, all waste is separated and recycled according to the official Swiss standards.', 'For example all paper, cardboard, PET, aluminum and glass is separated and collected centrally for recycling.', 'The remaining general waste is incinerated by Berns waste disposal company and the heat produced is used for electricity and thermal energy generation.', 'We are also giving our canteen food waste away so the city of Bern can burn it to produce energy.', 'IIC Sustainability Report Business travel Being a multinational organisation, it is an important part of our business to meet our stakeholders from our National Organisations, to our suppliers and our subsidiaries all across the world.', 'Business travel has always provided us and our teams with an insight and understanding of how other businesses work from the inside.', 'Although there is still no concrete green travel policy in place during , the Management Team has encouraged staff to implement further online meetings and video conferences as much as possible with the goal of decreasing our travel footprint further and protecting the safety of our employees.', 'Our IOF office in Shenzhen was affected with the pandemic already WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE Its not only important for IIC to track consumption for oil, energy and water consistently and accurately but also to identify areas where we can improve and lower our use of these resources.', 'We need to analyse the most resource intensive parts of our offices and try to find smart solutions.', 'To do so, we need a better tracking system, which will allow us to split the annual consumptions more in detail.', 'The safety and health of all employees and stakeholders was, and still is, of utmost importance.', 'This has meant that we not only have fewer travel expenses but also are able to decrease our energy consumption in the offices and travel emissions.', 'It is our aim to have the right mix of increased digital meetings and green business travels options for meeting our stakeholders in person.', 'Face to face meetings will remain an important part of our philosophy of building strong
