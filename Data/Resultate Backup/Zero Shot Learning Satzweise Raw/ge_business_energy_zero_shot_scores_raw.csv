We periodically review a range of actual and projected metrics in assessing these types of risks and opportunities, including new unit equipment sales, power generation by asset type, levelized cost of energy, levelized cost of storage, fuel prices including natural gas and hydrogen, pricing for mandatory and voluntary carbon offsets or credits, and internal and external modeling.', 'Our consideration of top climaterelated risks and opportunities also feeds into our annual longterm strategy review process, during which our businesses evaluate a handful of key questions related to their longterm strategies.', 'For example, during our Corporate Risk team worked with GEs Global Research Center and other internal and external experts on scenario analysis that modeled potential pathways for electricity generation consistent with a .°C target that required net zero greenhouse gas emissions by .', 'This analysis considered how electricity demand and supply could remain balanced over that time horizon with different combinations of power generation technology, as well as cost optimization for each pathway depending on the types of technology assumed to be available for use in the pathway.', 'Our businesses considered key themes and questions raised by this analysis as part of their annual longterm strategy reviews, including review during a strategy session with

several years, and in our energy businesses are undertaking additional modeling and scenario analysis to analyze potential decarbonization pathways in our industries and further develop our strategy setting and risk management activities.', 'For example, page describes the efforts of our coordinated Center for Decarbonization to focus on databacked analysis to support our planning.', 'We consider this type of internal analysis, as well as external modeling and scenarios such as the IEAs recent Net Zero by report, on an ongoing basis as we evaluate the opportunities, risks and resilience of our business strategy as it relates to the energy transition and climate change.', 'In our strategy development, we seek to build on GEs strengths in both innovating technologies and solutions to continue

business leaders, engineers, and strategic thinkers to ensure we improve our impacts to our communities, people, and planet in measurable and meaningful ways.', 'The CSO also supports efforts for GEs technology and innovation to address the pressing global challenges addressed in this report.', 'Sustainability at GE is the ultimate team effort, with GEs employees united in realizing the success of our mission.', 'The CSO also will operationalize GEs sustainability efforts by approaching sustainability with the same high expectations of rigor and accountability that we use to run our businesses, and will use lean principles, as described in more detail below, to continuously improve toward our goals.', 'We seek to continuously improve our processes to identify, assess, and respond to these types of climaterelated opportunities and risks, as this remains central to the strategy for our businesses.', 'GE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTBUILDING A WORLD THAT WORKS FOR TOMORROW Lean principles have long been a part of GEs sustainability strategy.', 'A critical component of GEs ongoing operational improvements are “treasure hunts” which are essentially targeted lean “waste walks” to identify energy waste, drive efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.', 'These processes bring together a local team to identify any source of waste at a worksite: open doors, lights and machines left on, wasted materials, as well as opportunities to invest in our operations to optimize performance.', 'Once these sources of waste or opportunities are identified, the team then implements the change necessary to eliminate the waste.', 'For example, a exercise at GE Aviations Celma facility in Brazil—which served more than , engines in —resulted in an percent reduction in energy use across the site.', 'LEAN MANAGEMENT IS DRIVING GES TURNAROUND—AND HELPING DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC When GE Healthcare needed to set up and attach accessories to thousands of medical monitors in record time to serve patients during the COVID pandemic, teams in the U.K. used lean principles to assemble and ship hundreds of systems to hospitals in just six weeks.', 'Demand for clinical devices that track heart rate, blood pressure, and other vital signs was high, and supply chains for monitor parts and accessories were strained.', 'Along with repurposing equipment, GE Aviation engineers, production teams, and volunteers used lean tools like problemsolving and feedback, a visual scheduling system called kanban, and rapid prototyping and iteration to assemble a monitor setup every four minutes—all while maintaining strict social distancing and tool and workstation sanitization schedules.', 'Its a cycle of try, fail, try again, fail, try again, succeed.” GE RENE WABLE ENERGY USES LEAN TO

maintenance crews to have the right parts in the field when they need them, and that the wind turbines GE services in Europe and the Middle East can keep spinning.', 'They are also the core of an ambitious global plan to overhaul how GE Renewable Energy maintains one of the planets most complex networks of onshore wind turbines—a plan that leans heavily on lean management.', 'The team in Europe used lean management to optimize inventory and cut delivery times.', 'The process also allows GE to consolidate its oil and grease supplies, which are key to maintaining turbines.', 'By doing so, GE avoids storing buckets of oil and grease at its several thousand turbine locations, where they may go unused, avoiding waste.', 'This is reflected in our three Leadership Behaviors: act with
