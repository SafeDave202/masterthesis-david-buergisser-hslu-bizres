INTRODUCTION Burkhart Grund Chief Finance Officer Board Member CSR Committee Chairman Permanent invitee to the Governance and Sustainability Committee July Our Transformational Strategy reflects our ambition to see luxury create benefits for all.', 'Despite the unprecedented difficulties stemming from the Covid pandemic, we have delivered and will continue to deliver our short, medium and longterm sustainability targets.', 'During the year, we have strengthened our governance through the creation of a Governance and Sustainability Committee of the Board, which is made up of non executive Directors.', 'Also attending Committee meetings are senior executives and specialists in Environment, Social and Governance matters ESG.', 'Its purpose is to assist the Board in reviewing and approving management proposals regarding strategy, policies, and guidelines on ESG.', 'For the first time, we engaged EY to assure our entire Sustainability Report.', 'We have studied their recommendations and will improve our ESG systems and disclosures each year.', 'Other experts were engaged to critically review our Standards of Business Conduct and our preparedness for reporting on due diligence regarding Business and Human Rights.', 'Richemont is cochairing a new Sustainable Development Goals SDGs Taskforce, launched by the Responsible Jewellery Council RJC to track and aid members progress in implementing the United Nations SDGs.', 'Looking at the social dimension of ESG, the past year has seen Richemont evolve its Human Resources Vision and Mission to become a truly peoplecentric organisation, offering our colleagues greater levels of listening and support across their entire employee journey.', 'This is reflected in our immediate response to Covid, where we acted to prioritise our peoples wellbeing and the preservation of jobs.', 'To this end, we are providing digital learning opportunities to support our New Retail journey, offering a revamped mobility strategy, and placing a greater focus on Diversity, Equity Inclusion DEI education and community building.', 'The People chapter contains further details.', 'Our Sustainability Report detailed the measures Richemont took in response to the Covid pandemic, which swept the world in early .', 'Those measures were broadly divided into four categories: health and safety; business continuity; remediation; and restart measures.', 'In certain markets, furlough arrangements were put in place and government assistance was received in others.', 'The overall impact on longterm employment has been limited and we are very grateful for the spirit in which our colleagues coped with the crisis.', 'Our rapid corporate level measures, combined with national vaccination programmes, suggest that our efforts to preserve cash and employment have been rewarded.', 'Richemont is committed to transparency and traceability in raw material sourcing and continues to work collaboratively with industry organisations and business partners to promote best practices across our full supply chain.', 'We are committed to respecting responsible business practices, human and labour rights, and the environment.', 'Today, over % of the gold we purchase is RJC Chain of Custody certified and comes from recycled origins.', 'As part of our longterm goal, IWC achieved certification against the RJCs stringent Chain of Custody standard: the first Swiss luxury watchmaker to be certified.', 'Other Maisons are on their way to obtaining this certification.', 'The Sourcing chapter contains further details.', 'Richemont has committed to sourcing % renewable electricity across Group operations by , in line with RE initiative objectives, and recently submitted its Science Based Targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.', 'Our target encompasses a variety of measures including absolute reductions intensity and supplier engagement.', 'We are reporting our water and waste metrics for the first time this year in response to both request from stakeholders and to prepare for targetsetting in the future.', 'The Environment chapter contains further details.', 'This report includes a chapter dedicated to our Maisons and regions individual progress.', 'This is the first time we have disclosed such detail, reflecting the maturity of their individual action plans, their willingness to communicate progress and to directly engage on sustainability matters with their own stakeholders, particularly their employees, suppliers and customers.', 'Our Group has a longstanding commitment to doing business responsibly.', 'We know that there is always more to do regarding corporate and industrywide sustainability efforts and strive to improve each year.', 'Next years Sustainability Report will reflect the recommendations of EY, additional ESG disclosures and will be published one month earlier.', 'Through these and many other innovative measures, at Richemont we craft the future.', 'In the meantime, we welcome your feedback on our enhanced sustainability performance and reporting efforts.', 'OUR APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY In , we launched our Transformational Strategy ‘Strategy, which reflects our aspiration for Better Luxury improving the way luxury is created, in a way that is more sustainable and responsible, and creating a positive impact for the many different stakeholders involved in our value chain.', 'The Strategy builds upon our previous CSR Plans and almost two decades of continuous improvement.', 'Our Strategy is graphically outlined below.', 'Our ‘Movement for Better Luxury is supported by four focus areas: People, Communities, Sourcing and Environment, each of which has an owner at Group level and a series of commitments.', 'These four areas are encompassed by strong governance, active stakeholder engagement and continuous innovation in materials and processes.', 'Our Strategy combines three levels of ambition over the short, medium and longterm, providing our Maisons with greater flexibility.', 'The Strategy was validated by two materiality assessment exercises in .', 'An enlarged version of this graphic may be found on our Sustainability Reporting Centre.', 'REPORTING ON OUR TRANSFORMATIONAL STRATEGY Building on progressive disclosures regarding our Strategy, this Report includes the specific targets linked to our shortterm Foundational and midterm Aspirational commitments.', 'It also includes our progress against those targets.', 'The details of those disclosures may be found in the respective focus area chapters of the report: People, Communities, Sourcing and Environment.', 'MATERIALITY Richemonts second materiality assessment was conducted in .', 'That comprehensive review identified the key ESG issues Environment, Social, Governance that matter most to our business and our stakeholders.', 'The materiality assessment confirmed that our Strategy is focused on the right areas and that we continue to report on the sustainability topics that are important to our stakeholders.', 'Corporate Citizenship, an independent consultancy specialising in sustainability, conducted that process in four stages: i Issue identification; ii Internal review and engagement; iii External engagement; and iv Validation.', 'Details of those stages may be found on page of our Sustainability Report .', 'Our next materiality update will be conducted in the year and be published in the next Sustainability Report.', 'That update will include comments from investors regarding their concerns and disclosure expectations in respect to ESG investing criteria.', 'Those topics are regularly reviewed, but recently received much greater importance in light of the Covid pandemic and foreseeable environmental crises.', 'MATERIALITY MATRIX An enlarged version of this graphic may be found on our Sustainability Reporting Centre.', 'They are i Human rights and labour standards in the supply chain and ii Transparency and traceability of raw materials.', 'Following discussion, a second materiality assessment was conducted.', 'An enlarged version of this graphic may be found on our Sustainability Reporting Centre.', 'Note: The issue areas are listed alphabetically within each relevant quadrant Our Sustainability Report page included a comparative discussion of the two matrices.', 'In summary, GenZ prioritised climate change as the most significant issue for Richemont.', 'This perception confirmed the importance of our ScienceBased Target project, which was duly prioritised and completed during the year under review.', 'Other areas, including diversity and inclusion, circular economy and positive social impacts were highlighted in the GenZ Edition.', 'REPORTING ON OUR MATERIAL ISSUES The materiality assessments have steered our disclosures, including the mapping of the issues to the Sustainable Development Goals.', 'It has also accelerated our project to set ScienceBased Targets for decarbonising our business operations in the decade ahead.', 'Issue Biodiversity Circular Economy Climate change other environmental impacts Community

Sourcing Maisons People Sourcing Sourcing These issues are also systematically addressed in our internal Enterprise Risk Management ERM report.', 'For the first time, we have produced a Sustainability Accounting Standards Board SASB index to illustrate how our reporting aligns with the Apparel, Accessories Footwear Industry guidelines.', 'This initiative is largely in response to requests from investors and other stakeholders who are more familiar with SASB than GRI.', 'We will continue to strengthen disclosures and align our reporting to SASB in future reports.', 'SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS The Sustainable Development Goals ‘SDGs or ‘Global Goals or ‘Agenda were set by the United Nations in .', 'The Global Goals range from ending poverty to working in partnerships, with each Goal having agreed targets.', 'Delivering the Global Goals is not reserved for governments, they are goals for individuals, organisations and companies of all sizes.', 'Richemonts Strategy includes a commitment to identify and align its operations with selected Global Goals.', 'During the prior year, a detailed mapping was conducted using our materiality assessment.', 'The chapter also draws attention to the SDG mapping conducted by partner organisations, including the Responsible Jewellery Council, TRACIT and United Nation Global Compact.', 'MAPPING OUR MATERIAL ISSUES TO THE SDGS Richemonts materiality assessment is described above in the Our Approach chapter.', 'The SDG Compass was used to guide this mapping process.', 'Further details of that process may be found on page of our Sustainability Report .', 'Material issue Biodiversity Circular economy Climate change other environmental impacts Community investment Craftsmanship Customer experience Data protection cyber

this graphic may be found on our Sustainability Reporting Centre.', 'Note: Material issues are listed alphabetically By seeking relevance, Richemonts contribution to achieving the Global Goals will be more focused: opportunities to leverage its capacities are being identified to become part of Richemonts future growth, for example, our strategic approaches to mitigating climate change and creating positive social impact.', 'RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS The five SDGs with the highest relevance for Richemont are SDG , , , and .', 'SDG : Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.', 'In particular, SDG .', 'As an example, Richemont has expanded its benefits programme for childcare services, including parental leave.', 'Several of our businesses have committed to the United Nations Womens Empowerment Principles, while others have achieved or are seeking Equal Pay certification across their operations.', 'In our supply chain, we promote equal remuneration for women and men, equal opportunities and diversity through certification schemes such as the Responsible Jewellery Council.', 'SDG : Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.', 'In particular, SDG .', '“Improve progressively global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation.” Our targets regarding occupational health, safety and wellbeing are described in the People chapter.', 'That chapter also describes the importance of talent and lifelong learning to preserve craftsmanship and employability in the luxury goods sector.', 'Our policies to safeguard human rights and labour standards in the supply chain and the positive social impact we make are described in the Sourcing chapter.', 'Implementing transparency and traceability in raw material sourcing, particularly materials which have positive biodiversity and environmental impacts such as American alligator leather, is included in the Environment chapter.', 'SDG : Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.', 'In particular: SDG .', '“Achieve the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources”; .', '“Substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse”; and .', '“Encourage transnational companies to adopt sustainable practices and to integrate sustainability information into their reporting cycle”.', 'Our longterm goals include the crafting of fully sustainable business models based in circular economy principles.', 'In the meantime, we are primarily using recycled gold in our new watches and jewellery pieces to minimise our negative environmental impacts and are reviewing all aspects of product packaging to minimise waste in the production and consumption phases.', 'An example is IWC Schaffhausens alternative packaging project, which offers customers smaller, lighter ways to travel with their new watches.', 'SDG: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.', 'We have committed to ScienceBased Targets in line with the Paris Agreement.', 'In parallel, we have also committed to lower our carbon emissions from business travel and to source % renewable electricity by .', 'Details of those commitments and our current emissions data may be found in the Environment chapter.', 'SDG : Partnerships for the Goals.', 'Through partnerships, Richemont is able to contribute to the SDGs beyond our own operations.', 'Of particular importance is the RJC SDG Taskforce, which was established during the year under review and is detailed below.', 'The Communities chapter of this report describes many of our philanthropic relations and how they contribute to society on a thematic basis.', 'An example is the Laureus Sports for Good Foundation and the benefits it brings to hundreds of thousands of disadvantaged children around the world each year.', 'Our partnership with standardsetting organisations enables us to build capacity beyond our operations as they promote dialogue and multilateral partnerships to achieve progress on the Global Goals.', 'PARTNER ORGANISATIONS RESPONSIBLE JEWELRY COUNCIL RJC The Responsible Jewellery Council RJC was established in to promote responsible ethical, human rights, social and environmental practices throughout the gold and diamond supply chains.', 'Membership of the RJC promotes a robust approach to supply chain issues for our Maisons and other businesses in the jewellery industry, from mines to retail.', 'The wider importance of the RJC and similar Voluntary Standard Systems to sustainability was recently underscored by a report prepared for ISEAL Alliance and WWF.', 'It concluded that sustainability standards have impacts that go beyond individual certified operations to influence whole production and consumption systems.', 'Civil society representatives include Human Rights Watch and a representative from a leading environmental organisation is being sought.', 'The Taskforce is cochaired by representatives from DeBeers and Richemont.', 'OTHER ORGANISATIONS In addition to our SDG work with the RJC, Richemont and its Maisons are also involved with the following organisations, which help us improve our social, economic and environmental performance: \uf0a7 Jewelers of America JA, the trade association for retail jewellers in the USA.', 'Through its Ethical Initiatives Committee, JA is a leader in promoting debate on sustainability within the industry.', '\uf0a7 The French Union of Jewellery, Silverware, Stones and Pearls UFBJOP, which is closely involved in various ethical issues and which promotes the highly skilled knowhow of jewellery manufacturing in France.', '\uf0a7 The Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FHS is a private, professional and nonprofit association.', 'It brings together more than members and represents more than % of all Swiss watch manufacturers.', '\uf0a7 WWF Switzerland, the national association of the World Wildlife Fund for Nature.', 'In , WWF Switzerland conducted an assessment of leading Swiss watch and jewellery companies environmental reporting.', 'Richemont and five of its Maisons participated in the assessment and continue to engage with WWF.', 'TRACIT is an independent, private sector initiative to drive change to mitigate the economic and social damages of illicit trade by strengthening government enforcement mechanisms and mobilising businesses across industry sectors most impacted by illicit trade.', 'TRACIT provides a strong partner for Richemonts commitment to sustainability, human rights and fair labour conditions, giving us a platform to stand against illicit trade in all forms relevant to our company.', 'As illicit trade weakens the viability and sustainability of industries, it simultaneously dilutes private sector contributions to achieving the SDGs.', 'In , TRACIT published an extensive report entitled “Mapping the Impact of Illicit Trade on the UN Sustainable Development Goals”.', 'TRACIT provides a platform for business and governments to collaborate holistically to mitigate the encumbrance of illicit trade and the associated human rights and labour abuses on the SDGs, and represents one of the ways Richemont contributes to the partnership approach embodied in SDG .', 'UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT The United Nations Global Compact UNGC is the worlds largest responsible business organisation.', 'The Swiss Network promotes the SDG Action Manager tool to guide companies efforts in achieving the Global Goals.', 'SDG ACTION MANAGER During the year under review, Richemont conducted its first internal assessment using the SDG Action Manager.', 'Those improvements relate to both our own operations and to our supply chain partners.', 'According to the SDG Action Manager database, our overall score was well above the Swiss average %, the sector average % and the average for similarsized companies %.', 'Within our overall score, our lowest scores related to human rights due diligence measures, whilst our highest scores related to anticorruption measures.', 'Our shortterm opportunities for improvement include employee training on the social and environmental issues material to Richemont; and devolving meaningful measures to track our contributions to the SDGs, particularly SDG decent work and economic growth and SDG responsible production and consumption.', 'Opportunities for improvement in the long term relate to governance and disclosures, including countrybycountry reporting.', 'These include i the Boards establishment in March of its Governance and Sustainability Committee, which oversees environmental, social and governance matters; and ii the Group CSR Committees establishment of dedicated steering committees for environmental and social impact, in March and June , respectively.', 'The advantages to Richemont of using the SDG Action Manager include easytouse benchmarking data and reference documents, clearly identified actions for improvement; and tools to track actionable progress.', 'The following chapter details our governance approach to sustainability.', 'This chapter includes a description of how sustainability is governed within Richemont and key developments during the year under review.', 'Those developments include: the establishment of a Boardlevel oversight body, the Governance and Sustainability Committee; an independent analysis of our ESG disclosures; an independent review of our Standards of Business Conduct; an independent review of our preparedness for monitoring Business and Human Rights; our first index according to SASB; and our first independent assurance of the entire Sustainability Report.', 'HOW SUSTAINABILITY IS MANAGED Responsibility for sustainability lies with the Group Chief Finance Officer CFO, who is a member of the Board of Directors and the Senior Executive Committee.', 'He regularly liaises with Maison Chief Executive Officers CEOs, function and regional heads and reports directly on CSR matters to the Board of Directors.', 'The CFO is supported by the Director of CSR Corporate Social Responsibility, the Groups CSR function and the Groups CSR Committee, comprising representatives from other Group functions and our Maisons.', 'Each of the four strategic focus areas of the strategy People, Communities, Sourcing and Environment is led by a director within the business.', 'CSR COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP At June , the CSR Committee comprised: Fashion Accessories Strategy and Transformation Director; \uf0a7 Group CFO Chairman; \uf0a7 Cartier Corporate Responsibility Director; \uf0a7 \uf0a7 Group Deputy Director, Public Relations; \uf0a7 Group Deputy Director, Strategic Planning; \uf0a7 Group Director, Corporate Communications; \uf0a7 Group Director, Corporate Social Responsibility; \uf0a7 Group Director, Diversity Inclusion; \uf0a7 Group

Sustainability Manager Secretary; \uf0a7 \uf0a7 Van Cleef Arpels Director, Compliance Risk Management.', '\uf0a7 YOOX NETAPORTER YNAP Senior Sustainability Manager.', 'The Chairman of the Governance and Sustainability Committee formerly the Ethics SubCommittee is invited to attend all CSR Committee meetings.', 'GOVERNANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE During the year the Board established a Governance and Sustainability Committee.', 'The purpose of the Committee is to support the Board in establishing and reviewing strategy, policies and guidelines with regard to environmental, social and governance ESG matters.', 'It acts in an advisory capacity to the Board, except for the following areas: • • • • regarding environmental matters it shall review and approve management proposals regarding CO targets, climate change and biodiversity; regarding social matters it shall review and approve management proposals regarding diversity, equity and inclusion as well as matters regarding human and workplace rights and positive social impacts within the Groups operations, its supply chain and the communities in which it operates; it shall further review and approve any material amendment to existing strategic plans relating to ESG, sustainability and any of their components; and it shall approve disclosures in the audited annual Sustainability Report and the Groups separate disclosures regarding ScienceBased Targets and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.', 'The Committee members comprises four nonexecutive directors: Mr Clay Brendish Committee Chairman and Lead Independent Board Director, Ms Wendy Luhabe and Mr Guillaume Pictet are Committee members; Mr Gary Saage also attends.', 'Mr Brendish, Ms Luhabe and Mr Pictet are independent nonexecutive directors.', 'The new Committee replaces the Audit Committees Ethics SubCommittee, which was established in the prior year.', 'CSR Representatives of each Maison and region participate in an annual CSR Conference to share progress and best practices, discuss activities and agree goals and priorities for the coming year.', 'The Conference held in January focused on our Transformational Strategy.', 'The conference provided an opportunity for CSR Representatives to understand the progress being made against our Foundational and Aspirational targets, as well as meet the owners of the respective projects to achieve such targets.', 'The event helped to energise Maisons and Regional actions in support of the targets.', 'As at March , the internal social network had active users.', 'Each Maison and regional function has its own CSR Committee or equivalent.', 'For the Maisons, the annual strategic planning process includes CSR objectives linked to its unique characteristics or ‘DNA.', 'The Maisons have also established crossfunctional teams, intranets and CSRdedicated social media groups.', 'There are expert working groups across Richemont on specific topics such as diversity, equity inclusion, community investment, precious materials and the environment.', 'The chapter on each Maisons progress is itself an innovation in this years Sustainability Report and reflects the growing confidence to communicate our sustainability efforts.', 'The aim is to strengthen knowledge and skills around a wide range of sustainability topics among the Maison CSR Representatives and their respective Committee members.', 'The content of the Faculty is currently provided by the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership ‘CISL.', 'Richemont has purchased licences of the Sustainability Essential for Business courses, but the Covid has delayed the completion of all this training.', 'The knowledge gained by our CSR Representatives will help to embed CSR across Richemonts businesses.', 'In addition to the CISL content, the Group CSR Function is developing content to engage all of our colleagues in sustainability topics relating to the Transformational Strategy.', 'TRANSPARENCY IN REPORTING We believe that transparent reporting and communications with external stakeholders is an important element for enforcing our processes and building trust.', 'There are a number of ways in which Richemont aims to do this.', 'In recent years, we have reported our approach to Data Protection and Information Security, our Tax Strategy, our Standards of Business Conduct and performance against our previous CSR Plans.', 'This year, in addition to disclosing the short, medium and longterm commitments of our Transformational Strategy, we are disclosing the Strategys mediumterm qualitative and quantitative targets and our performance to date across the four focus areas: People, Communities, Sourcing and Environment.', 'Enhancing product transparency and the traceability of precious materials used in luxury goods, such as jewellery, watches and leather goods, is an important focus area for Richemont and the wider industry.', 'This report covers the financial year ended March .', 'GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE ‘GRI Our Sustainability Report has been prepared in accordance with the Core option of the Global Reporting Initiatives GRI Standards.', 'SUSTAINABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ‘SASB During the year, we undertook a detailed analysis of our reporting against SASBs Apparel, Accessories Footwear industry guidelines, being the classification most relevant for our business.', 'We will continue to strengthen disclosures and alignment with SASB in future reports.', 'The priority areas identified in the Materiality Matrix are reported against the Sustainability Disclosure Topics and Accounting Metrics.', 'OTHER REPORTING FRAMEWORKS Richemont is following developments in the corporate, nonfinancial reporting space.', 'These various developments are seen positively as they represent a convergence, rather than a proliferation, of corporate reporting frameworks and standards and thus a potential simplification of future reporting requirements.', 'ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE ‘ESG DISCLOSURES During the year under review, Richemonts CSR Committee commissioned an independent study regarding ESG reporting.', 'The Committee was seeking a better understanding of the disclosures required by our investors, based upon their most frequently used ESG rating reports.', 'Those reports included CDP Climate, ISS ESG, MSCI ESG and Sustainalytics.', 'The DJSI criteria were also considered, but the reports using those criteria are less used by our investing constituency.', 'The resulting report identified the disclosure gaps which Richemont may decide to close in the short, medium and longterm.', 'To ensure a methodical approach and appropriate governance to future ESG disclosure enhancements, an Annotated Disclosure Dashboard ADD has been developed.', 'The ADD identifies the disclosure gap, the section of the Sustainability Report where the gap exists, the owner of the gap and the expected year when the gap will be closed.', 'Accordingly, the ADD will guide our continuous improvement efforts and provides the Boards Governance and Sustainability Committee with a tool with which to hold management to account.', 'INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE The Groups consolidated carbon emissions data were independently assured from to .', 'The baseline emissions for ScienceBased Targets, including a full assessment of Scope greenhouse gas emissions, were also independently assured.', 'For the first time, our entire Sustainability Report has been independently assured.', 'Our motivation for such an undertaking, particularly during the pandemic, were twofold: to improve the quality of our internal processes linked to nonfinancial disclosures; and to enhance trust among the users of our Sustainability Report.', 'During the year under review, the Board established a new standing Committee: the Governance and Sustainability Committee, as detailed above.', 'Richemont has a longstanding risk management process, which gives consideration to strategic and operational risks across all Group functions, including specific ESG risks such as sourcing and more general reputational and perception risks associated with sustainability.', 'The framework includes our Corporate Responsibility Policy, as well as codes of conduct for employees, suppliers and the environment, together ‘the Codes.', 'Our Transformational Strategy provides an overarching framework, together with detailed commitments and targets, which helps Richemonts managers, employees and suppliers to understand our expectations.', 'Training to embed these policies is ongoing and detailed in the commentary below and in the applicable chapters: People, Communities, Sourcing and Environment.', 'The changes reflect evolving best practice with regard to inter alia Business and Human Rights, whistleblowing and related matters.', 'Both revised documents will be published during the year ahead on our website within the Sustainability Reporting Centre area.', 'Employee and supplier training will accompany the revised Codes.', 'The Corporate Responsibly Policies and Environmental Code of Conduct were updated in and are reviewed periodically to ensure they reflect industry and regulatory best practices.', 'UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT Richemont has been a Participant in the United Nations Global Compact UNGC since and has provided an annual Communication on Progress in line with UNGCs requirements.', 'Global Compact Network Switzerland and Liechtenstein ‘GCNSL is the local chapter of the UNGC.', 'It promotes the UNGCs Ten Principles within the Swiss economic sphere and provides local support to UNGC participants.', 'A GCNSL documentary entitled “A Journey through Sustainable Swiss Business” may be viewed here.', 'SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS The Sustainable Development Goals ‘SDGs or ‘Global Goals or ‘Agenda were set by the United Nations in .', 'Richemonts Strategy includes a commitment to identify and align its operations with selected Global Goals.', 'BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights UNGPs form an overarching governing standard for nations, companies and civil society.', 'The UNGPs have been adopted by Switzerland, which has established a National Action Plan for Business and Human Rights BHR and has been applied to policies and standards such as those of the OECD and the Responsible Jewellery Councils Code of Practices.', 'To determine Richemonts preparedness for the UNGP, an independent expert study was commissioned during the year under review: a Business and Human Rights Gap Analysis.', 'The analysis reviewed Richemonts current BHR initiatives, policies, processes and commitments, compared to actual and emerging BHR expectations, standards and regulatory schemes.', 'The assessment criteria included a mix of internationally accepted standards, namely the UNGPs, the OECD Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, and two regulatory proposals at the regional and national level: the EU Mandatory Human Rights Due Diligence Draft Directive mHREDD and the Swiss Responsible Business Initiative counterproposal.', 'This analysis aimed at supporting Richemont in strategically advancing human rights through a clear understanding of its gaps against these requirements.', 'Prior to the implementation of those improvement measures, Richemont does not have a strategic approach to human rights and has not fully implemented the requirements of the UNGPs and the OECD Guidelines, with the exception of pockets of excellence such as raw materials sourcing at Group level and Cartier and its active engagement with the Responsible Jewellery Council.', 'From a disclosure perspective, Richemont is unable to prove that its commitment to human rights is implemented across the value chain and equally in all Maisons.', 'Current sustainability disclosures, from the annual report to the Modern Slavery statement, do not have sufficient details on how the company aligns with the UNGPs outside of direct sourcing of raw materials.', 'We note that a bespoke human rights policy is lacking, as well as a minimum standard for the Maisons on how to implement the companys human rights commitment in practice: through due diligence programmes, appropriate remedy and grievance processes, and monitoring systems.', 'The implementation of those action plans will be overseen by the Group CSR Committee and the Boards Governance and Sustainability Committee.', 'Until then, we will convey Richemonts position in each years Sustainability Report.', 'Swiss law is evolving in response to the Responsible Business Initiative counterproposal, voted by the Swiss people in November .', 'Richemont is monitoring the technical aspects of such developments, including due diligence processes, documentation, and disclosures for environmental and human rights in the supply chain.', 'The types of issues reported primarily related to employment and compliance matters.', 'Many of the employee incidents related to discrimination, bullying and harassment.', 'Many of the compliance incidence related to Covid measures.', 'Other reported issues included fraud and information security.', 'We continuously learn from each events findings and adapt our business practices when appropriate.', 'A more complete description of the independent studys findings, recommendations and changes to the way we work will be included in next years Sustainability Report.', 'ANTICOUNTERFEITING We seek to protect our clients from the sale of counterfeit goods.', 'Clients may be deceived by unscrupulous traders, who pass off fakes as genuine items.', 'In addition to this, Richemont is committed to a programme of civil enforcement using strategic litigations to highlight the issue and hopefully deter others from infringing our key assets.', 'Collaboration with the Maisons and their local platforms is a key factor to ensuring such anti counterfeiting actions are targeted and efficient.', 'A large number of fake products and infringements are removed every year by Richemont, both off and online.', 'Counterfeiting and piracy are highly pervasive across countries and sectors, representing a multi billiondollar industry that continues to grow globally.', 'The estimated global value of counterfeiting and piracy is some USD .', 'Those organisations are complicit in child labour, modern slavery, information may be found on Interpols website.', 'illicit distribution, fraud and tax evasion.', 'Further Richemont is a member of the Transnational Alliance to Combat Illicit Trade TRACIT, an independent, private sector initiative to drive change to mitigate the economic and social damages of illicit trade.', 'Further details may be found in the chapter on the Sustainable Development Goals.', 'This strategy is overseen by Richemonts Strategic Security Committee, which aims to protect the Companys assets, including confidential business information and intellectual property, and its operations against intrusive actions.', 'The GDPR is designed to harmonise data protection and privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens with respect to their personal data and to reshape the way organisations approach data

is largely achieved through active involvement and promotion of the Responsible Jewellery Council and the dissemination of the Groups Supplier Code of Conduct the ‘Code.', 'The Code includes our expectations of suppliers regarding ethical business practices, labour conditions, employment practices, human rights and the environment.', 'The Maisons have developed their sourcing strategies to take into account the risks of suppliers, or their suppliers suppliers, failing to meet the Groups expectations.', 'This is particularly the case for child labour and forced labour risks, which are assessed as part of the supplier qualification process and during any subsequent inspections and audits.', 'To fulfil our commitments and to increase sustainability, we will deploy our resources to improve transparency at all steps in our supply chains.', 'We define transparency as the capacity to identify all actors in our supply chains.', 'These efforts will be based on a strengthened due diligence process, starting with Tier suppliers.', 'Our goal is to support them as they deploy the same approach for their Tier our Tier and so on.', 'Our longterm goal is the traceability of all raw materials used in our products.', 'We understand many of the challenges associated with achieving traceability and are working closely with our suppliers and industry partners towards that goal.', 'In

Transformational commitments include the fostering of circular economy principles and delivering positive social impacts in our supply chains.', 'Karlheinz Baumann Group Industry and Services Director ENVIRONMENT Richemonts Transformational Strategy was launched in .', 'It reflects our aspiration for ‘Better Luxury: improving the way luxury is created in a more sustainable and responsible way and helping to create a positive impact for the many different stakeholders involved in our value chain.', 'This will predominantly be on Foundational commitments, which were due to be completed by December , together with any significant progress on other commitments within the Strategy.', 'Within the Strategy our environmental focus areas are: \uf0a7 Minimising our greenhouse gas, water and waste footprints; \uf0a7 Ensuring a high level of environmental stewardship across all activities; \uf0a7 Embedding circularity in our products and business models.', 'The end of concluded our

planned, but also for boutiques and offices.', 'It was applied for the first time in the prior yearend environmental reporting process.', 'The preliminary findings indicate that the taxonomy needed very few amendments during the year under review.', 'That initiative has encouraged our businesses to further engage with their landlords on waste management.', 'It has also prompted them to engage with landlords on Richemonts drive towards % renewable electricity.', 'The waste taxonomy was a Foundational goal on which to build future waste management targets in the Aspirational and Transformational periods and to effectively monitor such targets.', 'INVENTORY OF SYSTEMS IN PLACE FOR WASTE RECYCLING The inventory of existing local infrastructure and systems in place for waste recycling was scheduled to start in all our industrial sites during autumn .', 'The BOS teams around the world are motivated to develop this project as soon as the sanitary situation allows.', 'We therefore anticipate an acceleration of wasterelated projects and disclosure during the year ahead.', 'IMPLEMENT ENERGY MANAGEMENT CHECKLIST The Energy Management checklist was first published in April and was initially adopted by manufacturing and other larger operations on a voluntary basis.', 'Moreover, the checklist has been integrated into the audit referential used to externally assure our sites regarding EHS Environment, Health and Safety.', 'An implementation plan, linked to the annual onsite audits for health, safety and environmental matters at some sites was scheduled to begin in January .', 'Accordingly, the implementation of EHS and energy management audits have been postponed until operations can be run at nearnormal capacity.', 'In the meantime, energy consumption levels are lower due to temporary closures and safe working practices, such as working from home.', 'REDUCE PLASTIC IN BRANDED PACKAGING Many of our Maisons presentation boxes use plastic components.', 'Whilst some presentation boxes are kept for a lifetime and are passed on with the watch or jewellery piece, not all boxes are kept safely.', 'Indeed, some customers prefer to have only a small travelling pouch with their purchase.', 'Richemont was therefore interested to both reduce the amount of plastic used in its packaging and to broaden the choice available to its Maisons customers.', 'Branded packaging was one of the focus areas in a wideranging review of plastics used in our operations, our Plastic Shift Initiative.', 'During the prior year, the types and volumes of plastics used by all Maisons were analysed by material type, by carbon emissions and by Maison.', 'A pilot study by one specialist watchmaker was started, focusing on alternative materials.', 'The result will be a reduction in the volume of plastic components used in branded packaging and a broader choice for customers.', 'Monitoring arrangements will be put in place during the year to ensure

disclosed in our first response to CDP Water, which will be public in the coming months.', 'INCREASE SCOPE GHG MEASUREMENT Richemont began a sciencebased targetsetting SBT project in November .', 'The SBT project sought to identify the Scope greenhouse gas GHG emission categories which are relevant to the Group and not already captured in previous reporting cycles.', 'The project concluded in early with the audit of our SBT baseline year and proposed SBTs for .', 'IMPLEMENT ISOALIGNED ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS As discussed above, the new, extended EHS audit referential has not been deployed due to the sanitary measures.', 'If that is the case, then Richemont BOS will develop ISOaligned solutions for those sites.', 'The current view is that a full ISO certification may be too onerous, given the relatively low level of energy consumption in our industrial manufacturing processes, where small amounts of metal are processed to create fine watches, jewellery and writing instruments.', 'CATEGORISE REAL ESTATE PROJECTS Following a revision of the Groups internal approval procedure of commitments, a new criteria has been integrated which identifies projects that follow an environmental agenda.', 'Initiatives such as environmental certification or other action in favour of sustainable development can therefore be identified.', 'The objective is to compare producttopackaging ratios within and between our Maisons, identify outliers and learn from the findings.', 'REMOVE SINGLEUSE PLASTICS FROM CATERING The Groups Plastic Shift Initiative led to the internal publication of a ‘Zero Singleuse Plastics in Catering Activities handbook for Richemonts Facility Managers.', 'The short handbook provides guidance for staff restaurants, offices and external events, as well as recycling systems.', 'REMOVE SINGLEUSE PLASTICS FROM LOGISTICS Building on analyses of logistics consumables, the Group has been progressively eliminating single use plastics such as tape and significantly reducing the use of PU foam.', 'In parallel, Circular Logistics CL concepts are being developed with the objective of transporting goods with reusable packaging.', 'Care is being taken to ensure that these transportation runs are being leveraged to ensure that CL methods do not generate additional CO emissions.', 'REMOVE SINGLEUSE PVC ITEMS The Groups Plastic Shift Initiative led to internal recommendations of plastics to be preferred or be phased out.', 'As PVC Polyvinylchloride is the most environmentally damaging plastic, all singleuse PVC items shall be phasedout by the end of .', 'OUR APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT During the year under review, our approach was strengthened in two notable ways: \uf0a7 Setting our first ScienceBased Targets for emission reductions, in line with the Paris Agreement; and \uf0a7 Enhanced TCFD disclosures, in line with the recommendations of leading investment managers and the Financial Stability Board.', 'Our Environmental Code of Conduct the ‘Code may be found on our website.', 'It is built on national and international norms and standards for environmental management.', 'As well as universal environmental issues such as climate and the use of energy, water and other natural resources, the Code addresses the negative environmental impacts of key raw materials including precious metals, gemstones and leather.', 'Each business is expected to implement its own Environmental Management System, tailored to suit its size and type of activity.', 'The Group CSR Committee reviews environmental performance, determines new initiatives and reports progress to the Board.', 'Richemonts Internal Audit function includes environmental considerations within its systematic risk analysis and monitors compliance with the Code.', 'The results from those audits are used to drive continuous improvement plans over and above compliance with local laws and regulations.', 'The process to achieve certification with the RJCs Code of Practices also includes a review of environment matters.', 'Environmental data are consolidated annually, including the energy we use in our buildings, the fuel consumed as we travel for business, the impact of major logistics streams, and other elements necessary to calculate our carbon footprint.', 'The environmental data for was independently audited in January .', 'MINIMISE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS, WATER AND WASTE FOOTPRINTS CLIMATE CHANGE Context Richemonts carbon footprint is relatively small compared to that of energyintensive industries.', 'Whilst we do not see climate change as a significant area of direct risk for the Group, we recognise that managing the issues arising from climate change helps us to reduce our impact and thus contributes to one of the greatest challenges facing the planet.', 'Accordingly, setting carbon emission reduction targets was a core element of our Transformational Strategy.', 'During the year, Richemont calculated and analysed its overall carbon footprint, including Scopes , and .', 'This enabled the setting of ScienceBased emission reduction Targets SBTs in line with the Paris Agreement.', 'The analysis encompassed not only its buildings, travel and logistics, but also its purchased goods and services and other relevant Scope categories.', 'Our overall carbon footprint for the baseline was tCOe.', 'The following diagram summarises our footprint.', 'Following validation by the Board of Directors in midMay , the targets were submitted to the ScienceBased Target initiative for independent evaluation.', 'Accordingly, the following targets are subject to revision: “Richemont commits to reduce absolute Scopes and GHG emissions % by from a base year.', 'Richemont commits to reduce Scope GHG emissions from ‘purchased goods and services and business travel % per dollar EVA by from a base year.', 'Richemont also commits that % of its suppliers by emissions covering purchased goods and services and upstream transportation and distribution will have sciencebased targets by .', 'Richemont commits to increase annual sourcing of renewable electricity from % in to % by .', 'The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations Scopes and are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to .°C.', 'The renewable energy procurement target covering Scope emissions is consistent with reductions required to keep warming to .°C.” The overwhelming majority of our emissions are related to our supply chain: raw materials, logistics and so on.', 'Extensive preparatory work has been completed regarding Scope emission identification and reduction plan identification.', 'In the year ahead, these preparations will be converted into action plans at the Maison level, ensuring ownership of both the emissions problem and ways to resolve such problems.', 'The Group will continue to report its total, annual emissions to CDP.', 'The formulation of EVA is set by the SBTi and reflects EBITDA plus personnel costs wages, social security costs, employee benefits and pension costs.', 'Note that not all Scope emissions are included in the GEVA intensity calculation, only those stemming from two categories: purchased goods and services, and business travel.', 'Deducted from those two categories are the emissions which are targeted for supplier engagement.', 'Accordingly, Richemonts baseline intensity emissions were tCOe and GEVA was tCOe€m or tCOem.', 'Intensity baseline, Emissions G, tCOe Jewellery Maisons Specialist Watchmakers Online Distributors Fashion Accessories Corporate Total EVA, €m Intensity, GEVA € Intensity, GEVA The exchange rate applied was the average €:US rate for the twelve months ended March , being € .', 'In addition, since , we have purchased carbon offsets to neutralise our measured footprint for buildings, business travel and more recently logistics.', 'That logisticsrelated development reflected the quality of data and the acquisition of YOOX NETAPORTER YNAP in .', 'As a leading ecommerce business delivering goods to individual customers around the world, YNAPs logistic footprint is significant.', 'The cost of carbon offsets varies depending on the volume of carbon credits and the average price per offset.', 'The cost of offsetting our prior year footprint Scopes , and selected Scope only was some € .', 'million We raise awareness of the cost by reinvoicing each Maison.', 'This approach allows a real financial cost to be placed on carbon, which helps drive performance improvements, as does the motivation of employees in general.', 'We continue to carry out robust energy audits across our businesses and seek to respect the most demanding environmental standards when building new manufacturing facilities or refurbishing our Maisons retail network of some internal boutiques.', 'In this way, we play our part in minimising our energy consumption, provide agreeable working spaces for our employees, and thus contribute to the longterm sustainability of our business.', 'CARBON OFFSETTING We aim to reduce our Scopes , and emissions as much as possible and neutralise the rest by participating in certified offsetting projects.', 'Part of our CO emissions Scope , and Business travel and Distribution were offset by one major project and a variety of other projects: \uf0a7 The major project relates to forest preservation in support of transfrontier conservation areas ‘TFCAs facilitated by Peace Parks Foundation.', 'Specifically, the ‘Lower Zambezi REDD+ Project and ‘Luangwa Community Forests Projects.', 'This tranche of carbon credits represents part of a sevenyear agreement with BioCarbon Partners, a leading African developer.', 'By buying directly from the developer, the communities protecting these forests and Peace Parks Foundation will derive greater longterm security and financial benefits, thus enabling sustainable conservation efforts at scale.', '\uf0a7 Other projects include forest conservation in Peru and methane emissions capture for clean power generation in China.', 'To raise awareness, the centrallypurchased carbon offsets are reinvoiced to Richemonts individual Maisons, based on their own emissions.', 'The CSR Committee selects the offset projects and deepens engagement on climate change matters through internal and external communication.', 'As described in this chapter, the carbon footprint for the year under review will be offset using the REDD+ project above and other projects.', 'CDP Richemont has reported to CDP formerly Carbon Disclosure Project for many years.', 'Our most recent CDP rating for ClimateCarbon, received in December , was ‘A, implying Richemont is placed in the CDPs Leadership band.', 'WATER Water data was consolidated for the first time in the prior year, reflecting our commitment to identify and measure material waterusing activities.', 'In the first year, our focus was on our largest facilities, recognising that the great majority of sites are small boutiques with washrooms for employees and customers.', 'The largest facilities are concentrated in Western Europe, with distribution centres and aftersales service centres in other regions of the world.', 'Building on the quantity and quality of that data, this year we are reporting through CDP Water for the first time.', 'calendar year data will be reported via the CDP Water portal by July .', 'We have conducted a study which confirmed that Richemonts water consumption in our own operations has low, direct environmental impact.', 'The majority of our water consumption and related environmental impacts are indirect: they lie in our upstream supply chain, where raw materials extraction occurs.', 'We have also confirmed that, through the LWG certification mechanism, we have a good overview of leather tanneries and their water usage.', 'For the other supply chains related to our own raw materials, Richemont is assessing tools to make basinlevel risk assessments within the next three years.', 'As our waterrelated tools and targets are developed, further data will be made available in the coming years.', 'In the meantime, individual projects across the Group are being managed to reduce water usage whenever possible.', 'ENSURE A HIGH LEVEL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP ACROSS ALL ACTIVITIES ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS Environmental Management Systems ‘EMS refer to the management of environmental programmes in a comprehensive, systematic, planned and documented manner.', 'We have committed to implement such systems at a manufacturing site as a pilot over the next three years.', 'ISO is the most widely used EMS standard and we will align our own efforts with that standard.', 'RJC Code of Practices recertifications require a planned approach to environmental risk management.', 'Similarly, while no manufacturing sites are currently registered to ISO , energy efficiency is a guiding principle in the construction of new buildings and the refurbishment of existing buildings and interiors.', 'Twentysix boutiques have been certified using BREEAM and LEED Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.', 'As the Group has committed to % of all new buildings and refurbishments being certified each year by , many more boutiques will be added.', 'ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS Our Maisons engage their employees directly on environment themes in a variety of ways.', 'These range from communications on environmental good practices at work to financially incentivising employees to use public transport instead of private transport.', 'In addition, the gradual introduction of flexiwork practices, where employees may work away from their regular workplace one day per week, can reduce commutingrelated emissions by up to %.', 'The Groups CSR Committee has noted the evergrowing number of environmental initiatives reported by local CSR representatives in markets such as Japan, the USA, China and Switzerland.', 'The initiatives range from reducing the consumption of electricity in offices and boutiques to improving the thermal insulation of buildings.', 'Responding to a growing number of internal requests, Richemont prepared Sustainable Event Guidelines during the year.', 'The guidelines are based on a related International Standard ISO : and help event organisers to design events with a holistic view of environmental impact, ranging from how far the event guests need to travel to the type of hospitality offered.', 'Through its Supplier Code, the Groups operations encourage environmentally friendly practices among its direct suppliers and their suppliers.', 'Through the RJC, the Maisons participate in industrywide efforts to reduce the longterm environmental impact of largescale and artisanal mining.', 'Our Maisons also engage with NonGovernmental Organisations and civil society on environmental matters.', 'Please refer to the Engagement chapter regarding WWF Switzerland.', 'PLASTIC USED IN CATERING, PACKAGING AND LOGISTICS During , we began a process to measure and evaluate the types and weight of plastics used throughout our operations and whether better solutions exist, or whether volumes and weight can be reduced.', 'The study encompasses not only product packaging and logistics, but also singleuse plastic used in our catering facilities and during customer events.', 'The goal of our Plastic Shift Initiative is to phase out singleuse plastics as soon as possible and have evaluated alternatives, including reusable and recyclable materials.', 'These processes connect to our circular economy projects and to our logistics carbon footprint.', 'This has already reduced the weight of plastics used for logistics packaging by one third.', 'In catering, the shift from singleuse plastic cups in manufacturing spaces and washable materials in restaurants was welcomed by employees.', 'All singleuse plastics in catering are being phased out in and , with Switzerland our priority due to the number of employees and staff restaurants.', 'EMBED CIRCULARITY IN OUR PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS MODELS CIRCULAR ECONOMY We are assessing the implications of the circular economy in a number of areas, including new product, service developments and precious metals.', 'Together, these efforts seek to minimise our overall impact on the environment.', 'In addition to learning more about our customers motivations, this acquisition provides our customers with a professional, trustworthy and transparent platform for bringing ‘idle assets back into circulation.', 'The depth of understanding about when and why a current customer wishes to sell a watch and why a new customer wishes to acquire a preowned watch strengthens our customer relationships.', 'Moreover, Richemonts acquisition of a circular economy company like Watchfinder represents a business model innovation.', 'Watchfinder was an independent, UKonly company.', 'Since joining Richemont, it has developed operations in France, Germany, Switzerland, Hong Kong SAR, China and the USA.', 'The technology offered will provide access to product history and proof of authenticity, addressing the challenges of traceability, responsible sourcing and sustainability.', 'Richemont supported Cartiers partnership in the Consortium.', 'In a separate development to enable the circular economy, YNAP launched its Infinity programme.', 'The programme encompasses not only product sourcing, but also recommerce through its global platforms and steps to promote ecoawareness among its millions of customers.', 'Our gold sourcing strategy focuses on recycled gold over newly mined gold.', 'This choice reflects the estimated impact on the environment of alternative sourcing strategies: recycled gold has a significantly lower impact.', 'Further details may be found in the Sourcing chapter.', 'Bloomify is a pilot programme to sell boutique fixtures and fittings as well as spare promotional materials.', 'RESOURCE USE AND RECYCLING Our principal consideration in product design and development is to create high quality articles that will be treasured for generations.', 'This significantly reduces our product disposal impact.', 'Watches, jewellery and writing instruments account for % of Group sales.', 'Such items, together with the original presentation box, are typically passed from one generation to the next.', 'Alternatively, they may be sold through Watchfinder or at auction to collectors.', 'The great majority of the Groups products and presentation boxes therefore have no ‘end of life in the normal sense of product life cycles.', 'Other products, accounting for % of Group sales, are primarily readytowear clothing and leather goods.', 'As noted below, the Group has implemented the first steps in a comprehensive wastemanagement strategy, with the ultimate goal of zero waste to landfill from any major manufacturing and warehousing site.', 'Our commitments to monitoring the consumption of resources and to reducing waste are set out in our Environmental Code of Conduct.', 'Hazardous and toxic materials are treated in accordance with local and international regulations.', 'We strongly encourage management and employees responsible for packing and transporting goods to adopt an energyefficient strategy through the planning and organisation of shipments.', 'Workshops are being arranged to train Richemonts BOS and CSR managers to strengthen waste management practices and data.', 'A Groupwide water measurement and management project also started during the year as part of our Aspirational commitment.', 'PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP Richemonts Maisons consider the environmental impacts at the design stage for new products, reflecting the sensibilities of the Maisons designers and their customers.', 'In order to ensure the sustainability of their products, Richemonts Maisons are further developing their traceability tools while fostering the environmental and social responsibility of their suppliers.', 'The Maisons are particularly committed to ensure the compliance of their products towards all international chemical regulations, such as the European REACH regulations and California Proposition .', 'As experience in this area grows, our Maisons are progressively taking a proactive approach to identifying and phasing out certain toxic chemicals in order to ensure the security of its employees, customers and the environment.', 'PAPER AND PACKAGING For paper and packaging materials, Maisons and Group operations have chosen, whenever possible, to use % responsiblysourced woodbased materials.', 'Recognised certification schemes include the Forestry Stewardship Council standards linked to recycled content.', 'The quantity and weight of commercial printed materials, including catalogues, brochures and ‘house magazines is also under constant review.', 'The global shift towards digital media means less printing and less printed materials, especially paper.', 'We note that many customers are familiar with our Maisons products before entering the boutique and do not wish to carry away printed materials when they leave.', 'This is also the case for travelling customers, who do not wish to transport additional weight in their luggage.', 'Within our offices, we are methodically reducing the frequency and volume of printing.', 'This reflects a general tendency to ‘go paperless and the reconfiguration of many office spaces, placing those machines which print, scan or copy in a central area away from quieter desk and workbench areas.', 'OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT BIODIVERSITY Context Richemonts direct operations are not considered to have a high impact upon biodiversity.', 'However, the Groups Maisons make use of renewable and nonrenewable raw materials, such as gold, gemstones, leather and wood which have biodiversity impact.', 'Through our value chain, we seek to source these materials in a manner that is consistent with the protection of the environment and the sustainable utilisation of natural resources.', 'Examples include the very high level of recycled gold in our Maisons products and the certified woodbased material in the packaging around them.', 'We are also reviewing our use of plastics with the intention to eliminate singleuse wherever possible.', 'Our approach Our Environmental Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct set out our policies for sourcing responsible gold and conflictfree diamonds and gemstones, manufacturing leather products and protecting endangered species.', 'We fully comply with specific international and local regulations such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species CITES related to the procurement, import, usage and export of raw materials from protected species.', 'More information about how we deal with suppliers impacts may be found in the Sourcing chapter.', 'Moreover, our Supplier Code of Conduct is being revised to reflect greater specificity regarding biodiversity and certification schemes such as ‘organic.', 'Other actions taken by Richemont have a positive impact on biodiversity, as the following examples illustrate: \uf0a7 We seek to reduce environmental impacts in our supply chain and sourcing recycled, RJC certified gold is our preferred option.', 'Recycled gold has the lowest impact on biodiversity as neither land disturbance nor heavy trucks and plant are associated with reprocessing.', 'Currently, we primarily source recycled gold derived from old jewellery, industrial plating processes and manufacturing scraps.', 'Whereas gold recovered from postconsumer electronic goods is a potential source, the transparency and traceability of that supply chain is currently unsatisfactory.', 'Nevertheless, we are monitoring developments in that area and hope that obsolete electronics, such as mobile phones, can become a reputable source of recycled gold for our Maisons in the future.', '\uf0a7 Richemonts carbon offsets are primarily purchased in support of a REDD+ scheme along the Zambezi River.', 'The scheme preserves the wild forests by bringing a steady flow of cash to the communities who live there.', 'By publicising our longterm agreement with the agents of the forest and its links to Peace Parks Foundation, Richemont has motivated other companies to follow, including a twentyyear agreement covering one million hectares of Zambezi Forest.', '\uf0a7 Many of our Maisons use American alligator leather for making watch straps.', 'The alligator farming methods, including animal welfare certification, has helped to return the species population to safe levels in recent decades.', 'In parallel, the farmers conserve the biotopes on which species depend, including the alligators.', 'Moreover, the Louisiana wetland biotopes are critical for climate change mitigation as they sequester a significant amount of carbon.', 'Even more than many forests.', 'These observations regarding biodiversity preservation and carbon sequestration have encouraged our Maisons efforts to source American alligator leather.', 'Early in , Richemont formally joined the International Alligator Farmers Association.', 'In parallel, to raise awareness of these regenerative agricultural systems, Richemont representatives have spoken about them at the United Nations World Wildlife Day and at a number of specialist leather industry events.', 'Richemont is monitoring the development of voluntary corporate reporting standards linked to biodiversity.', 'In particular, i the ScienceBased Targets of Nature SBTN and ii the Taskforce on Naturerelated Financial Disclosures TNFD.', 'In addition, in the year ahead, Richemont will explore the development of biodiversity targets relevant to its own operations.', 'We have not addressed the CDP Forests reporting system at this stage as so few of Richemonts operations are linked to forest related activities, such as farming.', 'The overwhelming majority of leather goods are sourced from European farming practices.', 'We are committed to preserving the natural environment around all of our operations.', 'The majority of the Groups manufacturing facilities are located in Switzerland, France and Germany.', 'Those countries set high environmental standards and enforce them through national and local environmental legislation.', 'LOOKING AHEAD As we plan for a more stable future than this unprecedented past year, we have made some minor changes to our longterm targets.', 'Below, we have highlighted what we intend to achieve in the short, mid and longterm: SHORTTERM COMMITMENTS, IN THE COMING YEAR: \uf0a7 Finalise interim action plans for each Maison, linked to the Groups sciencebased targets; and \uf0a7 Regularly monitor progress against our other Coviddelayed Foundational targets and our Aspirational targets.', 'MEDIUMTERM COMMITMENTS, IN THE COMING TWO YEARS: Implement an Environmental Management System aligned with ISO at a pilot site; \uf0a7 Reporting waste and water usage, particularly at our larger, industrial sites; \uf0a7 \uf0a7 Develop our building certification strategy for all buildings; \uf0a7 Develop lighter packaging for our products, in line with customer requirements; and \uf0a7 Reduce plastic in general, in particular singleuse plastic, throughout our operations.', 'LONGTERM COMMITMENTS, IN THE COMING FIVE YEARS: \uf0a7 Developing new approaches to circularity, such as closing the loop on waste materials towards our goal of ‘zero waste to landfill; \uf0a7 Enlarging the proportion of revenues from ‘nonlinear business models, for example the sale of preowned certified watches, fashion and accessories recommerce and experimentation with nonownership business models renting, subscription; \uf0a7 Measuring the lifecycle impacts of our products and minimising their impact through innovative ecodesign; \uf0a7 Reaching % renewable energy; \uf0a7 Certifying at least % of all construction and renovation projects to green building standards; \uf0a7 Deploying Environmental Management Systems across all industrial sites and having the effectiveness assured independently; and \uf0a7 Embedding sustainable logistics and travel policies.', 'Matthew Kilgarriff Group Director, Corporate Social Responsibility DATA RELATING TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENTS AND TCFD Overall, the Groups activities have a very low direct exposure to the impact of climate change.', 'The production of highquality goods is concentrated in Switzerland and their distribution is spread around the world.', 'Similarly, the supply of precious materials, which is largely controlled by international diamond mining enterprises, precious metal recyclers and refiners, and gemstone cutters and polishers, is not expected to be disrupted by gradual changes in the natural environment.', 'During the year, Richemont aligned its climaterelated strategic governance, management and reporting practices with the TCFD recommendations.', 'TCFD, the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures, was established in and is driving transparent and consistent reporting on business risks and opportunities from climate change.', 'Richemont has neither quantified the financial risks associated with climate change nor identified weaknesses in our business model which would be worsened by gradual temperature changes, cases of extreme weather conditions or growing water scarcity.', 'Compared to previous disclosure, Richemont has improved its alignment with the TCFD recommendations by joining RE, submitting to the SBTi with reduction targets aligned with climate science, and by disclosing for the first time its audited emissions related to full Scope .', 'During the year of publication, Richemont has also created an Environmental Steering Committee to oversee Richemonts environmental strategy and to assess and manage climate related risks and opportunities.', 'Strategic alignment discussions will take place during the year ahead, including risks and opportunities for our Maisons and their customers.', 'Those discussions are expected to include raw material availability and the ecodesign of products and packaging.', 'In the meantime, our strategy is to align our business model with the transition to a net zero carbon economy by being forwardlooking, proactive and creative in meeting the need of our customers; by showing leadership whilst remaining collaborative; and in doing so, ensure that we

Renewable Energy % initiative ‘RE in February and previously committed to reach % renewable electricity no later than .', 'In the meantime, we will offset our remaining buildingrelated carbon footprint.', 'We recognise that buying renewable energy and offsetting are partial solutions to mitigate climate change.', 'The better solution is to reduce our buildings energy consumption in absolute terms.', 'This understanding has led to our Real Estate Departments decision to research and issue a series of booklets on lower energy solutions for better workspaces.', 'These booklets include ‘The Green Handbook for construction projects, ‘The Lighting Guide for LED illumination in workspaces and display cases, and ‘The Energy Monitoring CO Reduction Guide.', 'Scope During , Scope CO emissions decrease by % against baseline.', 'The rationale behind this variation is due to the Covid pandemic: less raw material was purchased, fewer products were manufactured and distributed, and employee travel was heavily restricted.', 'Note that certain Scope categories are not applicable to our footprint, based on the ScienceBased Target methodology.', 'Hotel stay emissions are considered

being purchased for watchmaking components and for fashion items.', 'In parallel, visibility of the raw materials purchased by our Maisons for their finished products increased.', 'This category comprises the raw materials used in our products, such as leather, coloured gemstones, gold and other jewellery raw materials.', 'Until relevant emission factors are available, hardstones, organic and semiprecious stones are excluded from Richemonts carbon footprint, except for Cartier.', 'We have implemented a higher granularity on origin for bovine leather, allowing us to evaluate the quantity sourced in Europe rather than the rest of the world and thus reduce our carbon emissions.', 'We included in our calculations of this category the emissions linked to branded packaging, point of sales material, logisticsrelated consumables, printed material, office supplies and vegetarian and standard meals consumed in company restaurants.', 'We also considered the services whose emissions have increased by % compared to last year, due mainly to an improvement in our data collection process.', 'Our Maisons branded finished products are included in this category, considering raw materials and related manufacturing processes.', 'As YNAP is mainly purchasing thirdparty branded products, to calculate emissions we consider the finished goods by type.', 'To accelerate practical knowhow and
