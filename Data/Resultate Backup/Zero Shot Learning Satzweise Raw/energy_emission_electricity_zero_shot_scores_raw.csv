decentralised energy sources and the increasing number of market players due to electrification, is making the system increasingly complex.', 'On the one hand, the system will shift from being organised around a small number of power plants and inelastic demand to one which encompasses a portfolio of small, decentralised generation sources and flexibility means such as electric vehicles, batteries and heating systems.', 'On the other hand, the high presence of variable renewable generation sources will result in daily cycles of oversupply and undersupply of energy compared to load needs.', 'The efficient management of decentralised means will become crucial for guaranteeing the ade quacy and flexibility of the network; TSOs will need to be more flexible to keep the system in ba lance.', 'To tackle this increase in complexity and main tain a reliable and affordable energy supply, new investments and innovative tools are needed.', 'Digital technologies will be key for enabling TSOs to handle the increasingly complex system and become more efficient, whilst operating as part of an interconnected European energy system.', 'All these tools are necessary for ensuring an

Transmission System Operators The growing share of fluctuating RES in the electricity mix increases the flexibility and security of the systems supply needs in daily, weekly, seasonal and annual terms

ment signals can be provided by the energyonly market, but price signals can be distorted for different reasons, hindering the gene ration of optimal investments.', 'In this case, longterm investment signals can be provided through regulatory instruments such as support schemes for RES and capacity mechanisms.', 'In this regard, European electricity TSOs play a pivotal role in assessing challenges and proposing solutions for the efficient integration of resources into the markets and grids.', 'As mandated by the Clean Energy for all Europeans package, these two types of player have already established formal collaboration channels through their associations ENTSOE and the DSOs associations.', 'Key areas of mutual exchange involve common practices for scenario building and grid planning, ensuring an improved visibility over distributed resources and the definition of com mon principles for the integration of flexibility resources into the grid.', 'Another fundamental step for increasing the efficiency of the electrical system and ensuring a transition to carbon neu trality at the least cost for society involves the integration of fragmented energy markets across European countries.', 'TSOs can play a pivotal role in creating an internal European energy market, facilitating the crosszonal trading of energy and ancillary services and further increasing regional cooperation.', 'Although market integration has been already implemented in several areas across Europe, as mandated by the Clean Energy for all Europeans package, there is still a need for harmonisation and the development of consistent common network codes.', 'This would minimise the curtailment of nonprogrammable renewables and ensure operational security and resource adequacy in

systemDECARBONISING THE ENERGY SYSTEM The role of Transmission System Operators Supporting electrification The electrification of energy consumption involves the replacement of end use technologies supplied by fossil fuels with electrical ones direct electrification or with technologies supplied by energy carriers produced from lowcarbon electricity indirect electrification.', 'As part of their enabling role, TSOs fully support both forms of electrification outlined above, with the aim of decarbonising the whole energy system at the lowest cost for the society.', 'However, while both types of electrification are needed to achieve carbon neutrality in the longterm, they also impact the electricity network.', 'This simultaneously poses new challenges for TSOs whilst presenting them new opportunities for enhanced grid operation.', 'In this regard, TSOs regularly undertake modelling studies of the power system to verify the impacts of electrification on the electrical system in the short, medium and longterm.', 'These studies are often used to inform national and European energy policy for example, they are included in scenario reports and energy strategies.', 'DIRECT ELECTRIFICATION Direct electrification involves the replace ment of end use technologies which emit high amounts of carbon and are typically less efficient with electrical ones.', 'The end uses with the highest direct electrification potential are vehicles and heating systems.', 'The latter can be carried out alongside energy efficiency measures to im prove the thermal performance of buildings.', 'INDIRECT ELECTRIFICATION Indirect electrification involves the replace ment of end use technologies that emit large amounts of carbon with alternatives supplied by gaseous and liquid fuels or heat produced from lowcarbon electricity.', 'Hydrogen technologies sup plied by lowcarbon hydrogen produced by PowertoGas PG plants will prevail in future.', 'With the aim of enabling the decarbonisation of “hardtoabate” sectors, electricity TSOs will support the effective integration of PG plants, which will also contribute to meeting the longterm flexi bility requirements of the energy system.', 'ELECTROMOBILITY HEATING SYSTEMS The EU is aiming for million electric vehicles to be deployed by , while up to million are expected to be deployed by based on future energy scenarios.', 'EU Energy scenarios for provide for up to times the heat currently produced by electrical heat pumps, with significant geographical diffe rences across Europe.', 'Time of use tariffs could be useful to mitigate the impact of electromo bility on the grid.', 'Smart charging could also provide TSOs with flexible resources to enhance grid operation.', 'Charging infrastructure designed to be vehicletogrid VG ready could provide system operators with additional flexibility opportunities.', 'The widespread adoption of electrical heating systems are likely to have a limited impact on the overall electricity demand, while potentially incre asing system adequacy needs in countries with the highest technology switching ratios.', 'If DSRenabled, the electrical heating system could represent a source of flexibility for TSOs.', 'POWERTOGAS The EU hydrogen strategy provides for GW of electrolysers to be installed by and estimates that lowcarbon hydrogen will cover % of the energy consumption by .', 'Based on the specific configuration of electrolysers, their use will impact the electricity network.', 'In cases where PG plants are connected to the grid, TSOs will have to ensure an effective and secure integration of the additional RES required to supply them and manage the associated electricity flows.', 'Depending on the system conditions, electrolysers could provide flexibility potentials for balancing and redispatching services.', 'Electrolysers will also represent a flexibility resource, as they can be used to convert the seasonal or interannual excess of RES generation into green fuels, whi ch can in turn be used in the directly in “hardtoabate” sectors or converted back into electricity during periods when there is a shortage of RES generation.', 'The location of large electrolysers is an important aspect that needs to be considered for the efficient development of infrastructure, guided by coordinated network development plans between electricity and gas TSOs.', 'However, the optimal localisation of electrolysers depends on countryspecific considerations.', 'Transporting renewable power in the form of hydrogen over long distances could be an economically attractive option, in cases where there is a demand for hydrogen, there is already pipeline infrastructure in place or this could be developed as a result of coordinated network development plans.', 'The development of an appropriate legal and regulatory framework and a market design that provides locational, when necessary, and operational incentives for electrolysers is also essential.', 'Introduction AnnexHow TSOs contribute to GHG emission reductionThe role played by electricity in the decarbonisation of the energy systemDECARBONISING THE ENERGY SYSTEM The role of Transmission System Operators REVEALING THE FULL DECARBONISATION POTENTIAL OF TSOs THE EU TAXONOMY REGULATORY In order to meet the EUs climate and energy targets for and reach the objectives of the European Green Deal, investments should be directed towards sustainable projects and activities.', 'This is why the action plan on financing sustainable growth called for the creation of a common classification system for sustainable economic activities, or an “EU taxonomy”.', 'With the objective of climate change mitiga tion in mind, the EU taxonomy defines technical screening criteria for assessing the contribution of TSO activities to the energy transition.', 'According to this taxonomy, each activity undertaken by TSOs makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation if: • the transmission infrastructure or equipment is part of the interconnected European system; • more than % of newly enabled generation capacity in the system is below the generation threshold value of gCOekWh measured on a life cycle basis, over a rolling fiveyear period; • the average system grid emissions factor is below the threshold value of gCOekWh measured on a life cycle basis, over a rolling fiveyear period.', 'The following activities are considered as always eligible according to the EU taxonomy framework: the construction and operation or expansion of direct RES connections; the installation of Tier transfor mers; the installation and operation of equipment or infrastructure aimed at integrating more renewable generation or increasing the controllability and observability of the network; interconnections between electricity systems, where at least one is considered compliant to taxonomy criteria.', 'Therefore, the vast majority of TSO activities fall within the aforementioned scope and are thus consi dered as activities that enable the energy transition.', 'To enable the electrification of consumption and the integration of a large amount of additional RES capacity into the system, TSOs will have to manage the resulting complexity by investing in network developments and innovative services to keep the system stable and secure.', 'Building new transmission lines and grid assets such as new transformers, synchronous condensers, etc.', 'and managing the higher flows resulting from the electrification of end uses and integration of intermittent RES will in fact inevitably lead to additional consumption for construction works and additional grid losses.', ""However, when observing this from a systemic point of view, the positive impact deriving from the implementation of tools enabling GHG emission reduction at system level will ultimately also con tribute to the reduction of the TSO's carbon footprint."", 'For instance, the additional grid losses that could result from the construction of a new line connecting an offshore wind farm to the onshore grid and the associated GHG emissions will be outweighed by the integration of the renewable energy generated by the wind farm into the system.', 'This example highlights the importance of assessing the decarbonisation potential of TSO activities by considering their impact on the energy system as a whole.', 'Moreover, this role is only partially recognised in costbenefit analyses included in national and Eu ropean grid development plans.', 'Revealing the full decarbonisation potential of TSOs, and thus their role in enabling the achievement of Europes climate goals, requires the adoption of a systemic approach one that would explicitly recognise TSOs as enablers of the energy transition.', 'Their enabling activities need to be explicitly mentioned in GHG emission inventories under common assessment and monitoring frameworks, next to GHG emission sources associated with TSOs carbon footprint.', 'With this in mind, the EU taxonomy regulation for sustainable activities published in July re presents a good example of common criteria to assess the contribution of TSO activities to climate change mitigation and adaptation.', 'This EU framework aims to direct investments towards sustai nable activities.', 'It recognises the enabling nature of TSO activities by using a systemic approach and assessing their overall impact on the emission factor of the whole European electricity system see box on the next page for further information. .', 'Such
