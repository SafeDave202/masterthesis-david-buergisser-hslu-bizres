annual sustainability report.', 'The year got off to a very good start.', 'We began with many projects planned, a full innovation pipeline, and a great deal of anticipation for a very good year for ORIOR.', 'Meanwhile, sales in retail and ecommerce increased sharply.', 'The effects of the pandemic also left their mark on our sustainability efforts.', 'In this report, our intention is to show you what we have been able to achieve in our sustainability strategys nine fields of activity, where we have been able to make progress, and where we experienced some setbacks in part due to the pandemic which we will be remedying in the coming years.', 'One of the highlights was most definitely the launch of the new ORIOR Strategy .', 'The central role of sustainability, or our “ORIOR Responsibility” as we like to call it, was confirmed and reinforced in the ORIOR Strategy .', 'ORIOR SUSTAINABILITY REPORT CEO Statement Since drafting our sustainability strategy in autumn and the publication of our first Sustainability Report in , we have learned a great deal both in general terms of sustainability and about how multilayered the issues are and how very closely they are linked to our business and our success.', 'Based on our current perspective, Im very glad and grateful that we tackled the issue of sustainability early on, because it is extremely broad and its challenge lies in the many small details connected with it.', 'For this reason, we continued to work on refining, systematising and embedding our sustainability management in and pushed ahead with the planned measures in the nine fields of activity.', 'Thanks to the Sustainability Committee on which I also have a seat and our overarching sustainability management, our organisation is set up in such a way that we can quickly and easily capitalise on potential for improvement and translate it into concrete measures.', 'One of the most difficult and timeconsuming tasks within sustainability reporting was and is data collection.', 'The team is currently working on a sustainability dashboard, which will also simplify and automate data collection even more and provide a rolling view of our performance.', 'At the end of the year, and for reasons well known to us, the sustainability developments realised during did not fully correspond to our original plans and targets.', 'With regard to environmental responsibility, we were able to achieve further positive efficiency gains by implementing technical and processrelated measures, although we also had to accept coronavirusrelated setbacks in certain areas such as food waste.', 'And finally, in the area of social responsibility, the major advances made in occupational safety and health certainly deserve special mention.', 'We also succeeded in ensuring that our employees receive comprehen sive protection and have kept the illness rate consistently low.', 'However, we were able to and had to drive forward sustainable development in the area of digital learning and digitalisation in general.', 'Un der normal circumstances, this would hardly have been possible at the pace and to the broad extent with which we realised it, and it will enable us to achieve a great deal of efficiency and seamless collaboration in the future as well.', 'We can, want and must contribute to a better future in harmony with the globally valid Sustainable Development Goals SDGs.', 'ORIORs primary goal is to generate added value for all stakeholders.', 'We can only achieve this when we also achieve steady improvements in the area of sustainability, because sustainability is the basis for Excellence in Food, an opportunity to differentiate ourselves, and our concrete commitment to the generations of tomorrow.', 'My sincere thanks go to each and

Prioritising health and ensuring supply readiness The coronavirus pandemic made a particularly challenging year.', 'The measures ordered by the authorities, including restrictions on travel and so

management through weekly telephone conference calls.', 'Thanks to flexible and agile structures, we have succeeded in adapting production within a very short period of time to meet the shifts in the types of product in demand and the redeployments this entailed, enabling us to fulfil the significantly increased demand from the retail sector.', 'In this way, we have been able to make our own contribution during the crisis, since the ORIOR Group, as a food company, is considered systemically important for the Swiss populations food supply.', 'Unfortunately, like many companies, we had to put some employees on shorttime work.', 'At the rest of our competence centres, only a small number of employees were affected by reduced hours, mainly because we managed to quickly retrain staff and deploy them in other areas.', 'Thanks to our early preparations for scenarios relating to the new federal regulations, the close coordination between the competence centres and the Group management,

'Depending on the product range, production location and method, significant social and environmental im pacts can occur in our upstream value chain stages, such as greenhouse gas emissions, high water con sumption, biodiversity losses or unacceptable working conditions.', 'In addition, as a market participant we are also affected by global developments linked to sustain ability, e.g.', 'For this reason, we are committed in the long term to contributing to more sustainable agricultural meth ods within planetary boundaries.', 'To achieve this, we use the relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals SDGs, see above and the Paris Agreement as our guide.', 'In addition to the environment and the people who work in the agricultural industry, animal welfare is also of great concern to us.', 'The meat they supply is one of ORIORs most important raw materials.', 'Topics such as animal husbandry conditions and feeding, the use of antibiotics, as well as transport and slaughter are the main focus.', 'We are making a positive impact in this area through our purchasing policy and activities.', 'We take our responsibilities seriously by establishing requirements for the origin and production methods of our raw materials and by marketing products that provide both social and ecological added value.', 'That is why we have also set ourselves targets regarding the type of raw materials we want to process in the future.', 'With regard to plant and animal raw materials, our goal is to increase by % by the share of certified sus tainable and organic raw material purchases in the raw material categories most relevant to us.', 'In the case of animalderived raw materials and in view of the high animal welfare standards in Switzerland, we have set ourselves the goal of ensuring by the year that we only process meat for the Swiss market that originates from Switzerland itself or from other producers whose practices comply at a minimum with Swiss animal pro tection laws.', 'Furthermore, we want to continuously in crease the proportion of our sales of labelled products.', 'We employ the following measures to improve the sus tainability of our raw materials and animal welfare: We focus on the most essential raw materials.', 'We specify the origin of raw materials.', 'We work with certified suppliers and importers.', 'ORIOR SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Product responsibility We want to focus our efforts on the raw materials whose production we can impact most positively through our purchasing behaviour.', 'As a diversified Food Beverage group, we process many different plant and animal raw materials for our products.', 'We prioritise these accord ing to criteria such as quantity, strategic importance and price in order to define the raw materials that are most important to us.', 'The following six raw material categories are currently included: pork, beef, poultry, fruit and vegetables, durum wheat, and eggs.', 'These include soya, palm oil, fish and seafood.', 'Key raw materials and our minimum requirements Raw material Relevance and the ORIOR approach Pork Beef Poultry In terms of volume, pork is the most important animalderived raw material for the Swiss ORIOR competence centres.', 'It is processed mainly for the Rapelli Salumeria delicacies, Albert Spiess Bündner specialities, and Möfags ham and bacon creations.', 'Local availability is good we currently source over % of our pork in Switzerland.', 'Beef also plays a central role in the ORIOR product range used mainly for Albert Spiess Bündnerfleisch drycured beef, Rapellis grill and gastro products, and Fredags food ser vice channel.', 'It is difficult to meet the demand for Swiss beef through domestic production alone.', 'The demand for organic beef in particular outstrips the supply.', 'We secure our local supply chain by cultivating relationships with our suppliers and planning our purchasing as far ahead as possible depending on the market and demand situation.', 'We currently use .% Swiss beef for the Swiss market.', 'Together with the export goods, for which we use European meat, the Swiss share accounts for .% of total beef purchases.', 'Whenever possible, we source our poultry meat from local farms.', 'However, demand for poultry is so high and continues to rise that domestic supply falls far short of meet ing it.', 'We currently purchase .% of our poultry in Switzerland.', 'For imports, we work with our supply chain partners to source meat from abroad that has been produced in accordance with Swiss animal welfare standards whenever possible.', 'An example of this is the Migros Animal Welfare Programme, which will enable us to procure Brazilian chicken meat that meets Swiss animal welfare standards from onwards.', 'ORIOR SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Product responsibility Raw material Relevance and the ORIOR approach Fruit and vegetables Durum wheat Eggs Fish and seafood Fruit and vegetables play an important role in our Convenience segment.', 'Biotta pro cesses by far the highest percentage of these raw materials for its organic juices.', 'Whenever possible, we use local, sustainably grown, organic andor certified vegetables and fruits.', 'We are able to source .% of these from Switzerland, with a further .% coming from other often nearby European countries.', 'A total of .% of our purchased fruit and vegetables currently carry an organic label.', 'Semolina and durum wheat flour are a key raw material for our Pastinella pasta com pany.', 'We source durum wheat mainly from Europe and North America and are increasing ly choosing certified organic raw materials to enhance our ecological contribution.', 'At present, .% of the durum wheat we purchase bears an organic label.', 'Eggs are used primarily in the production of our pasta specialities and for menu com ponents, pâtés and panades.', 'We are pursuing the goal of continuously increasing the percentage of eggs from KATcertified freerange management or higher in our purchasing to ultimately achieve %.', 'Pastinella has already been complying with this standard since .', 'Overall, the percentage of freerange eggs used at ORIORs Swiss competence centres is .%, and .% of the eggs also carry an organic label.', 'We source a limited amount of fish, seafood and shellfish for our convenience products and certain retail goods.', 'We use the WWF Fish Guide as an aid to avoid sourcing endangered species and also rely on sustainability certificates such as MSC, ASC and organic.', 'During this reporting year, our percentage of fish and seafood purchases that met the WWF Score was .%.', 'We do not source any genetically modified raw materials and adhere to the FDHA Ordinance on Genetically Modified Food GMFO.', 'Furthermore, in the case of our pâté and terrine specialities we only use livers from nonforce fed ducks and geese.', 'ORIOR SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Product responsibility Specification of origin of raw materials We procure a large proportion of our raw materials from within Switzerland as we know these materials meet worldleading standards for quality, sustainabili ty and animal welfare.', 'Moreover, this allows us to min imise rawmaterial transport routes and keep the as sociated environmental burden as low as possible.', 'As a bonus, we also contribute to the preservation of the local primary economy, which is in all our interests.', 'Switzerland has some of the strictest animal pro tection laws in the world, which is why we source as much meat from Switzerland as possible.', 'Since , all ORIOR Switzerland meatprocessing companies have been members of the Proviande trade organi sation and purchase from accredited meat suppliers only.', 'All cattle slaughtered on farms inspected by Pro viande are verified for their Swiss origin using a DNA check.', 'In the case of foreign companies, we are work ing towards ensuring that production takes place in accordance with the provisions of the Swiss Animal Welfare Ordinance and that both human rights and en vironmental standards are respected.', 'To this end, we maintain close partnerships with the Cooperative for Livestock and Meat Import GVFI as well as with raw material suppliers abroad.', 'Whenever possible, we procure meat from Switzerland.', 'ORIOR SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Product responsibility Why ORIOR relies on Swiss animal welfare standards Switzerland is recognised as having some of the strictest animal welfare legislation in the world, as well as the toughest animal transportation laws.', 'This is why ORIOR relies primarily on animalderived raw materials from Switzerland and aims to increase its percentages even further.', 'Animal husbandry Whereas industrial livestock operations with tens of thousands of pigs or hundreds of thousands of chick ens are widespread in various EU regions, factory farming in Switzerland is limited.', 'Animal handling and observation is much easier to ensure with smaller herd sizes.', 'The EU has no upper stock limits and allows each country to set their own limits for domestic farming operations.', 'The stipulated space allotted per animal is also more generous in Switzerland % more for pigs and al most % for chickens.', 'For cattle, there is no existing EU regulation for minimum space per animal.', 'There are no detailed EU wide husbandry rules for raising horses, cows, turkeys, goats or sheep.', 'Looking ahead: Factoryfarming initiative and counterproposal The initiative against factory farming, which was launched in , calls for even stricter animal wel fare requirements and wants them enshrined in the constitution.', 'Among other things, the initiative stipu lates regular outdoor exercise and even more space for cows, pigs and chickens.', 'In autumn , the Federal Council sent a counterproposal for consul tation, which would also include animal welfare in the constitution and outline standards for more space, activity and exercise for all farm animals, as well as slaughtering methods that are more humane.', 'ORIOR SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Product responsibility Relying on labels In order to achieve our goals, we also rely on recog nised, trusted standards, labels and certifications that stipulate strict requirements to minimise the impact on the environment, people and animals.', 'We prioritise such labels in our own purchases and at the same time want to increase the proportion of labelled products we sell.', 'We assign labels to one of three categories: labels for organic farming, other sustainability labels, and labels of origin that provide information about the materials origin but not about specific ecological and social cul tivation conditions.', 'Frequently used labels and sustainability standards Organic labels Additional

'When it comes to our own brands, we launch new certified products every year.', 'The situation is more challenging in the con tract segment, where the requirements are strongly influenced by our customers, and in the food service channel, where demand for certified organic products is still significantly lower than in the retail trade.', 'This illustrates once again the importance of working close ly with our partners and raising awareness among all stakeholders to promote the implementation of a sus tainable food supply.', 'Partnering with suppliers We are very aware of the value of good partnerships and working closely with others to achieve our sustain ability goals, and we maintain close, longterm relation ships with our customers, suppliers and partners.', 'We strive to be fair and equitable in all our business rela tionships.', 'In order to ensure sustainability and qual ity, we rely on partnership programmes such as the implementation of the “Particularly AnimalFriendly Housing” BTS standard for suppliers abroad.', 'If our standards are not achieved or are not complied with, the first step we take is to arrange a personal meeting with the suppliers to identify the causes.', 'ORIOR SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Product responsibility Activities Pig Plus Health Programme The use of medications, particularly antibiotics, is strictly regulated by the Swiss Animal Welfare Act.', 'Despite this, medications are sometimes used more intensively than is necessary for the animals health.', 'For this reason, the Swiss pork industry launched the Pig Plus Health Programme in .', 'Its aim is to further reduce the use of antibiotics in pig breeding and fatten ing farms in particular, and as a means of preventing any resistance.', 'The participating farms commit them selves to recording in an electronic treatment journal all treatments, including the use of medications, together with other key data.', 'ORIOR participates in this health programme in coop eration with other industry partners to ensure the good health and welfare of Swiss pigs.', 'As a pro gramme buyer, we paid an additional premium to the participating producers.', 'When this phase ends in April , participation will become mandatory for all pig From bean to tofu in organic quality breeding and fattening farms producing under the “QM Schweizer Fleisch” the quality management system for Swiss meat producers.', 'Ingredients with sustainable added value During this reporting year, we were able to switch our purchases in various raw material categories to more sustainable alternatives.', 'The following examples pro vide an insight: During the pandemic year of , demand for organic products increased throughout Switzerland.', 'Fredag continued to take advantage of this trend with its vegetarian specialities.', 'The majority of products whose sales grew strongly compared with the previous year are organic.', 'The “Noppas” organic tofu spe cialities from Fredag experienced particularly positive growth, including items such as silken tofu, smoked tofu and tofu balls.', 'Fredag sources premiumquality organic soybeans from Switzerland for its production.', 'Freerange eggs at Pastinella Pastinella has been using % freerange eggs since for its fresh pasta specialities.', 'New products with quality labels In cooperation with our partners we are continuously working to expand our range of certified labelled prod ucts.', 'Some of these are new product creations that are certified directly in compliance with organic or other sustainability standards, while other existing products can often be adapted to meet certified label quality.', 'ORIOR SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Product responsibility Demeter carrot juice from Biotta Biotta launched a Demeterquality juice for the first time in its carrotorangeginger juice.', '“demeter” is one of the organic labels on the market that sets the highest standards for raw material production and food processing.', 'The main raw material, Demeter carrots, comes from Fritz Lorenzs farm on Lake Constance.', 'IPSUISSE Nostranella from Rapelli The IPSUISSE label stands for ecological and integrated agriculture.', 'This year we once again expanded our range of IPSUISSE products, e.g.', 'The new salami also features more sustainable paper packaging.', '“Us Ämmitaler Güggle” Fredag successfully launched a new product line
