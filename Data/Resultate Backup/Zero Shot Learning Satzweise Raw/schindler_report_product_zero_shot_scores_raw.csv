'SCHINDLER CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT The first related to the integration of diversifying social and economic functions into the city fabric.', 'Today, some years on, the legacy of this citybuilding logic has not dimmed but intensified.', 'Processes of imperi alism and then globalization, digitalization, and rapid urbanization, especially in Africa and Asia, through the twentieth and earlytwentyfirst centuries, escalated Now, with the threat of climate change looming, a grow ing multidisciplinary scientific consortium is warning that future cities built following this old logic will generate resource demands that exceed the biophysical limits of the planet several times over.', 'Accommodating unprecedented urban population growth, while repairing environmental degradation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigating climate change, is the fundamental challenge for city builders today.', 'How could contemporary cities be retrofit ted and adapted?', 'In short, how might we contribute to what UN SecretaryGeneral António Guterres called the emerging “groundswell of climate action.” One approach is to reform unsustainable citybuilding around a framework for highdensity, lowfootprint cities.', 'One approach is to reform unsustainable citybuilding around a framework for high density, lowfootprint cities.', 'There is widespread scientific and policy consensus that upbuilding remains a fundamental principle for sustainable cities for example, the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs, the Paris Agreement United Nations Convention on Climate Change, and the New Urban Agenda Habitat III.', 'Taken literally, building up can support higher popula tion densities, and higher densities bring many benefits.', 'These include the convenience of diverse and colocated services, the clustering of complementary jobs, the energy efficiencies of proximate consumers and reduction of travel demand, and the intensification of urban experi ence.', 'What does the corresponding SDG say?', 'Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable Only half the world‘s population has convenient access to public transport % no access Over % of COVID cases are in urban areas % urban HIGHLIGHTS PAVING THE WAY INTRODUCTION ROADMAP OUR REPORTING AREAS : ENVIRONMENT I SOCIETY I GOVERNANCE APPENDIX Setting the scene: an external perspective Furthermore, by curbing urban sprawl or limiting the physical footprint of buildings and roads highdensity cities can reduce development pressure on foodproducing hin terlands.', 'In the literal sense, highdensity cities are always lowfootprint cities because the buildings that constitute them accommodate people and activities by extending vertically and occupying rela tively small portions of land.', 'The lens of the ecological footprint, which aims to “document the extent to which human economies stay within the regenerative capacity of the biosphere,” reveals the environmental impacts of build ings more forensically.', 'This perspective generates new pressing questions concerning the life cycle of highdensity spaces, how they are constructed, serviced, connected, and occupied over time.', 'Hong Kong is regarded as one of the highdensity highliveability cities.', 'Scientists are increasingly confident that highdensity cities can offer environmental advantages.', 'But current data is not definitive, and so many socio technical factors are not yet well understood.', 'Building up involves assembling sophisticated materials and tech nologies for heating, cooling, managing waste, and com municating.', 'How density shapes a city can depend on the kind of jobs and economy that it supports.', 'For example, Singapore, London, Tokyo, and Hong Kong are regarded as highdensityhighliveability cities.', 'Yet, the form of density in each city is quite different, and the social, cultural, and geographical character of liveability such as tolerance for and enjoyment of crowding, life aspirations, place attachments, and forms of social solidarity also dif fers markedly across these cities.', '“This perspective generates new pressing questions concerning the life cycle of highdensity spaces, how they are constructed, serviced, connected, and occupied over time.” SCHINDLER CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT It has been said that sustainable future cities are likely to be built up around elevators rather than cars.', 'The possibility of highdensity, lowfootprint cities also depends on how they are connected and interconnected.', 'It has been said that sustainable future cities are likely to be built up around elevators rather than cars.', 'Certainly, without integrated nonmotorized transport choices and efficient mass transit options, cities will continue to rely on highemissions privatecarbased systems.', 'Shared vertical, horizontal, and responsive transport systems within dense urban fabrics are imperative.', 'Shared vertical, horizontal, and responsive transport systems within dense urban fabrics are imperative.', 'The framework for highdensity, lowfootprint cities neces sarily embraces the realities of both physical and environ

shares his view on the role of technologies in enabling cities to prosper and our customers to succeed in a low carbon and inclusive future.', 'Building on ecofriendly materials First off, technological advancements will allow for the development not only of greener building materials, but also of new manufacturing processes that have a better ecological footprint.', 'Timber is a highly sustainable material.', 'Much research has gone into how engineered timber can be designed and manufac tured to improve its fire safety performance, robustness, and durability.', 'This has resulted in this technology crossing into the midrise building segment.', 'Thanks to RD investment, in recent years, greener alter natives have begun to emerge.', 'This trend of ecofriendli ness through technology is set to continue.', 'The Elevator Escalator EE industry, too, has been a champion of sustainable innovation.', 'Thanks to its elevator belt technology, which allows for light elevator cars and compact elevator motors, Schindler has one of the most materialefficient systems in the market and we are con tinuing to explore ways to further reduce materials use.', 'Among other things, we are looking to improve our use of ecofriendly materials reducing our use of hazardous materials to a strict minimum, while using recycled materi als when possible.', 'The EE industry, too, has been a champion of sustainable innovation.', 'The industry is moving towards a cradleto cradle approach, where the environmental impact of the entire product life cycle is taken into consideration in the design process from sourcing through to production, use, and disposal.', 'That means components are manufac tured so that they are easily disassembled, with materials separated for reuse and recycling.', 'Enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings The engergy efficiency of buildings once in operation is another critical aspect in making cities more sustainable and there again, technology is key.', 'System providers in sustainable cities will continue to strive for the highest energy efficiency whether in the area of building insula tion, the design of heating and cooling solutions, or the design of highly efficient permanent magnetdriven eleva tor motors that feed braking energy back into thes grid.', 'The crucial role of urban mobility systems Urban mobility is, of course, a critical variable in the sus tainable city equation, with technology being at its core.', 'The quest for optimizing the use and interlink age of existing urban mobility means the use of trains, sub ways, tramways, elevators, moving walks, and cars contin ues.', 'HIGHLIGHTS PAVING THE WAY INTRODUCTION ROADMAP OUR REPORTING AREAS : ENVIRONMENT I SOCIETY I GOVERNANCE APPENDIX A forwardlooking perspective Which technologies are key to enabling sustainable smart cities and how would you define a smart city?', 'A smart city is a city where subsystems communicate to make intelligent decisions based on the data they share with each other.', 'We think of intelligent decisions as ones that lead to greater user convenience and better overall energy performance ultimately helping to improve the energy efficiency of a subsystem.', 'A buildings smart heating and cooling system provides a classic example of smart devices working together for the benefits of users and owners: while incorporating weather data, the heating and cooling system is able to interact autonomously with the buildings exterior blinds to let more or less sunlight and heat into the building.', 'Another example is solar panels, which charge the battery of an electric car when the energy is not used in the building.', 'In general, in a smart city, energy producers and consumers act more intelligently together to save energy.', 'Schindler PORT Schindler PORT has created a suite of mobile apps and services that enable smoother traffic management in buildings by reducing waiting times and congestion.', 'See website Elevator technology, too, can optimize a buildings energy performance.', 'Schindler PORT, our transit management technology, for instance, can be linked with peoples travel intentions in a building.', 'With the knowledge of where people are headed, elevator cars can be dispatched in an SCHINDLER CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT optimal way to optimize energy efficiency and traffic ca pacity.', 'At the construction level, this higher traffic capacity means also that fewer of these elevators are needed freeing up space for other use.', 'In a few years from now, elevator technology will allow us to reduce peak energy demands, which will lead to clear environmental benefits.', 'By integrating elevators into smart grids, we will be able to coordinate the energy demand of elevators with the citys other energy producers and con sumers resulting in a more stable grid and more efficient production and consumption of energy.', 'Connectivity in smart cities does not just allow for city sub systems to work more efficiently together, it also allows us to live and work more sustainably.', 'In the elevator industry, connectivity plays an increasingly important role, with predictive maintenance and connected elevator units being more common.', 'That means some elements of physical maintenance visits can be replaced with virtual checks, reducing the need for field trips allowing us to reduce the amount of CO emissions generated by our service fleet.', 'How important is collaboration between planners, architects, constructors, and developers in making digital technology work well for city dwellers?', 'The design of an energyefficient building is a complex undertaking and one that involves a lot of different parties.', 'Thats where Building Information Modeling BIM and our Digital Twin will make a notable difference.', 'Used in combination, these technologies provide a cen tralized, place for providers, planners, architects, and developers to exchange information, doing away with plan ning inefficiencies while drastically reducing mistakes on construction sites saving money and time in the process.', 'Building Information Modeling BIM An intelligent technology based on D modeling, BIM provides traceability and insights throughout the project life cycle planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance.', 'See website the product development, enabling continuously improving quality and safety for passengers and technicians alike.', 'A next stage will include using Digital Twin for data insight collection and realizing the full potential of artificial intelligence.', 'Digital Twin Schindlers Digital Twin accelerates every stage of the value chain of elevators and escalators from planning to operation and mainte nance through digital modeling and simulations.', 'Virtual prototyping and analytics are applied in every phase of With our Digital Twin, it will also soon be possible to simu late at the planning stage the energy consumption of a unit, to provide a breakdown of the material used in its manufacturing, and to estimate its CO footprint.', 'This comprehensive overview can inform further design optimi zations to increase the sustainability and energy efficiency of a project.', 'More broadly speaking, city planning is critical in making cities not only sustainable but enjoyable to live in cities with less traffic and more green spaces.', 'Urban neighbor hoods and what is known as “slow traffics” greener forms of transportation will come to define the cities of tomor row, ones where work, leisure, and recreation are more integrated.', 'Schindler will be able to tap into its wealth of experience in mixeduse buildings and campuses to help shape the cities of tomorrow.', 'See
