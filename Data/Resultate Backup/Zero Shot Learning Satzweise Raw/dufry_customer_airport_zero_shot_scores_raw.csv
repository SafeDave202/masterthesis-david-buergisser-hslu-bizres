operational challenges, will continue to develop the company fol lowing its longterm successful strategy of sustainable and profitable growth and building on its trackrecord of rapid expansion through organic growth and acqui sitions.', 'The same is true for travel retail in general, which is seen as a resilient industry despite the current turbulence generated by the pandemic.', 'In , under previous normal market conditions, Dufry had a mar ket share of % in travel retail overall, and close to % in airport travel retail, which accounted for % of our business.', 'Fostering retail excellence to create stakeholder value Travel retail is the connecting and central element of three very important industries: retail, travel and lei sure locations, as well as consumer goods brands.', 'Our strategy to achieve this goal: we focus on offering the best services to our customers to create profitable and sustainable growth for all our stakeholders.', 'Our clear travel retail focus, where we mostly concen trate on locations with captive audiences, creates a winning formula for all stakeholders of the Dufry eco system.', 'For customers, by providing an unrivalled shopping experience; for suppliers, by showcasing their brands to a fastgrowing group of affluent customers; for landlords, by fully exploring the commercial poten tial of a travel or leisure location; for shareholders, by creating longterm value through generating cash and profits and for employees and local communities, by creating job opportunities and wealth.', 'For an overview of the Dufry stakeholder ecosystem please refer to page .', 'This includes local product offerings, as cus tomers also increasingly want to complete their travel experience by bringing home memories, as well as in ternationally recognized brands that are well known and much liked.', 'Our shops combine the famous assort ments of global brands and highquality products with a special local touch, which differentiates our shops worldwide and wherever they may be at airports, sea ports, ships, railway stations and also in downtown or border locations and irrespective of whether they are dutyfree or dutypaid.', 'For a selection of our main re tail concepts please refer to pages through of this brochure.', 'For this reason, Dufry sets high priority on consumer intelligence, extrapolated from internal op erational information, regular customer field surveys and external research.', 'This permanent tracking of customer behavior is the base against which to con tinuously finetune our offering, not only matching, but exceeding expectations of our clients.', 'The Global Travel Retailer For suppliers we offer access to the largest footprint in the ever more attractive travel retail channel, through more than , of our shops in over lo cations in countries, further supported by our growing digital footprint.', 'Our shops offer suppliers an unrivalled worldwide opportunity to promote their brands and products, reaching an affluent consumer segment and allowing them to purchase their prod ucts at our various locations.', 'In recent years, we have seen an increasing impor tance in novelties, exclusive products and limited edi tions to attract customers to our shops.', 'Despite some shortterm shift and the growing importance of food and convenience products related to the faster accel eration of domestic travel during the COVID pan demic recovery, the longterm interest to find new and unique products and experiences is maintained.', 'Landlords get the highest productivity from their re tail areas, maximizing their revenues when working with Dufry.', 'We enable landlords to offer their travelers attractive commercial spaces, thus in creasing revenues from nonaeronautical sources and further optimizing their overall business performance.', 'For shareholders, Dufry is the worlds leading global travel retailer, offering an attractive investment oppor tunity to participate in a growing industry and a com pany that focuses on profitable growth and strong cash generation.', 'Despite the current challenging business environment, travel retail is a structurally resilient growth industry with a proven trackrecord.', 'On the dutyfree side, the airport channel is expected to continue to be the largest and fastest growing part of our business.', 'We continue to see additional poten tial in further developing the cruise ship and ferry business, dutyfree border shops currently mostly in South America and downtown dutyfree shopping in selected markets, mainly in Asia, where this type of operation is particularly popular, due to specific local regulations.', 'Geographic diversification is the best way to benefit from the evergrowing number of travelers worldwide, as we can leverage the captive audiences in our loca tions.', 'Our global presence also allows us to evaluate thoroughly the opportunities of new projects in any location by capitalizing on the expertise of our local teams.', 'Today, Dufry is not only the global market leader in travel retail, but also by far the most diversified player in the industry.', 'Furthermore, geographic diversification considerably mitigates risks generated by external impacts in sin gle markets or regions.', 'This has been widely proven in , when our global footprint mitigated the impacts of geographically differing restrictions and contain ment measures associated with the pandemic.', 'With the largest concession accounting for around % of our business, and with the ten biggest representing less than % of sales.', 'Diversification by channel and sector widens the scope of the company providing access to additional customer groups and behaviors.', 'In this context, the cruise and ferry businesses, train stations, and also border shops and downtown locations such as hotels, casinos and leisure resorts are gaining in importance.', 'Diversification: by geography, by channel, by sector and digitally.', 'Cruise lines offer an attractive channel to engage with customers during a longer time period, and ferries have been quite resilient even throughout the current crisis.', 'Despite the momentary challenges the cruise business is experiencing, we are convinced that this type of vacation will continue to be “en vogue” in the longterm.', 'The dutypaid sector also has considerable develop ment potential in airports, since the expected growth of domestic passengers including intraEU travel is similar to that for international travelers.', 'Furthermore, this sector is fragmented even more than dutyfree, thus offering attractive new expansion opportunities.', 'We also continue fos tering the expansion of our successful dutypaid re tail concepts, Hudson and Dufry Shopping which are already implemented in several markets and have po tential for further deployment.', 'Hudson is a wellestab The Global Travel Retailer lished convenience store concept that has been very successful in North America over the past years and which, since , we have deployed in coun tries worldwide such as Italy, Switzerland, Brazil, UK and China among others.', 'Dufry Shopping is a duty paid concept that offers a highquality assortment of international brands in an exclusive setting, similar to a dutyfree travel retail store, but targeting domestic passengers.', 'We originally piloted Dufry Shopping in Brazil in , expanding to locations across the country and the immediate success has led us to a strategic decision to roll out this concept into other countries.', 'The first Dufry Shopping store outside Brazil opened in at Las Vegas McCarran International Airport.', 'This was followed by the Malta Dufry Shopping in and by the contract signed in with Newark Liberty Inter national Airport for a new Dufry Shopping, and the newest shop in Salt Lake City, which both opened in .', 'Also in , we further opened Dufry Shopping stores at the Fortaleza airport in Brazil and at Odessa airport in Russia.', 'Based on the positive results with Dufry Shopping locations in countries so far, we are convinced that this concept can be successfully rolled out to other markets globally.', 'Its characteristics, which allow to considerably in crease customer engagement crosschannel, cross geographies and crosssector, and to serve customers from when they plan their trip to the moment when they return home, are a great asset.', 'They enjoy strolling through the attractive retail spaces and take away memorable shopping experi ences.', 'To at tract more customers to our stores we want to provide a superior customer experience and in addition, create further value through a more efficient business.', 'We are also digitalizing the shops to increase conver sion rates and to simplify instore processes, focus ing on areas such as product consultations, payments, locationsspecific promotions etc.', 'Financial discipline focusing on returns At Dufry, we have a disciplined financial approach to all our projects, be they organic or acquisitions.', 'We carefully analyze every project or significant invest ment with detailed projections and with a focus on minimum return requirements.', 'This includes a careful assessment of the initial investment needed to build and set up the stores as well as the cost structure, profitability and cash flow generation of the business once it is operational and over time.', 'This culture of giving importance to returns and cost control has allowed us to grow our business profitably and capture opportunities in many different markets.', 'The Global Travel Retailer As part of our financial risk management, we minimize business risks by implementing a highly variable cost structure.', 'These defensive characteristics help to pro tect the business in case of downturns, which are usually local and temporary, thus providing a solid and resilient profile.', 'Resilient cash flow generation.', 'Dufrys typically strong cash generation capacity is a combination of the companys usually solid profitabil ity and the low capital intensity of our business.', 'Pre pandemic and based on the business perfor mance, Dufry would expect to further improve its cash generation capacity in line with topline growth.', 'Post full recovery and going forward, we are confident that cash generation capacity will continue to be one of the key drivers of our strategy implementation, and will even accelerate based on the structural measures taken.', 'Organic growth complemented by acquisitions Dufrys fundamental growth strategy continues to be characterized by a combination of organic growth as well as MA opportunities with increased visibility on the pace of recovery.', 'Although, the current COVID pandemic might slightly delay some expansion proj ects from a landlords perspective in the shortterm, travel retail remains a resilient industry on a mid to longterm horizon, and we expect to see further growth and partnership opportunities going forward.', 'With respect to organic growth, the travel retail indus try has the unique advantage of benefitting from a secular increase of travelers around the world and of fering the great opportunity to directly engage with them.', 'Consequently, organic growth will continue to be an important driver of Dufrys development going forward.', 'We will focus on driving sales through implementing bestinclass shop concepts in dutyfree and dutypaid, by further deploying our digital strategy and by evolving the proven marketing and promotional activities we have used and finetuned over the years.', 'Besides benefit ting from additional passengers in line with regional developments, we expect to further increase our retail space, be it through expansion in existing locations or by winning new contracts in airports and alternative channels.', 'At Dufry, we tradition ally maintain a sizeable project pipeline, allowing us to grow our retail space in different channels, regions and sectors.', 'Offering the best retail experience for international and domestic travelers in multiple channels, Dufry currently generates about % of its revenues in duty free and % in dutypaid operations, with both sec tors continuing to offer further, substantial growth opportunities.', 'Longterm passenger growth remains a key driver in travel retail.', 'Despite the consolidation seen in travel retail over the last years, the industry remains relatively fragmented, with the top players controlling just over half of the market and the remaining market consisting of small and mediumsized operators.', 'With respect to The Global Travel Retailer North America we will continue to expand our foot print with dutyfree and dutypaid operations comple mented by airport FB.', 'Longterm industry fundamentals remain strong despite shortterm challenges While in tourism and travel were heavily impacted by the spread of the pandemic, we have also seen encouraging behaviors from passengers around the world, who have resumed travelling as soon as restric tions were lifted.', 'This is an important indication that the fundamental resilience of travel retail is unchal lenged and that the industry will confirm its attrac tiveness as a growing retail channel featuring its own growth dynamics, which are not comparable with high street retail.', 'While visibility on the travel pattern recovery remains low, prepandemic, external industry specialists such as AirCast estimated global passenger numbers to grow by around % per annum, which translates to a potential of over million new customers for the industry every year.', 'We believe that being the global market leader also means being at the forefront of this development.', 'The Global Travel Retailer Focus Story ESG STRATEGY ONGOING EVOLUTION OF DUFRYS SUSTAINABILITY ENGAGEMENT Every day our employees serve close to , customers in our over , shops in

and expanded new shops adding over , m² of retail space across all divi sions.', 'At December , , the entire concession portfolio of the group included retail space of close to , m² thus strengthening our portfolio, despite some crisisrelated closures we had to perform.', 'Dufrys concession portfolio is highly diversified and well balanced across emerging and mature markets on all six continents.', 'This considerably reduces risks of being exposed to single markets and operations; the largest concession only accounts for approximately % of turnover; while the biggest concessions rep resent less than %.', 'Focusing on investment returns In , our organization has followed its approach of financial discipline even more closely when evaluating new projects and opportunities a methodology suc cessfully developed in the past, which has proven its value during the present challenging environment.', 'Projects are analyzed individually on a commercial and financial basis.', 'Through a strict evaluation of these criteria and our disciplined approach to returns, we ensure that our concession portfolio remains of the highest quality and that each concession offers attractive returns for the

elements.', 'Besides the New Gener ation Stores, services such as Reserve Collect and above all the loyalty program Red By Dufry have a global span and are therefore able to promote our op erations online and reach travelers across the world.', 'Successful contract extensions secure future business In travel retail, concession contracts are a key busi ness driver for retail operators, as they provide the right to sell their products at a given operation.', 'In , Dufry continued to win new contracts and to re new existing concession contracts, thus successfully strengthening the remaining average lifetime of its portfolio, which is currently years.', 'Within our con cession portfolio, % of our contracts have a remain ing lifetime of one to two years; % of three to five years; another % of between six and nine years, and the final % have a remaining duration of ten years or more.', 'In average, Dufry renews existing contracts that generate between % and % of our sales every year, while at the same time adding new contracts.', 'This in cludes a network of over , shops across more than locations in countries on continents.', 'As Dufry operates dutypaid and dutyfree areas alike, the company can serve both domestic and international travelers equally interested in convenience products and luxury shopping experiences.', 'In a normal, prepan demic environment, over one billion passengers regu larly passed through locations where Dufry operates shops, making us the perfect partner and ambassador for global brands.', 'This makes travel retail a highly attractive and Dufry a preferred partner for global and regional brands.', 'In this context, we of fer each brand a customized approach to create com mon goals for the supplier and for Dufry on specific actions and distinctive campaigns to be implemented on an individual basis.', 'The attractiveness of our joint offerings became prevalent in a higher spend per passenger in the second half once travel resumed.', 'Centralized procurement and logistics With a focus on generating efficiencies, Dufry is per manently streamlining its key processes.', 'Through our centralized procurement and logistic functions, we have considerably simplified the entire supply chain.', 'Our Global Category Managers act as key relationship managers for brands and coordinate activities with suppliers.', 'They define brand plans with suppliers and negotiate all contractual parameters.', 'Dufry has also centralized and simplified the ordering process, by in ternally aggregating the orders from the different re tail operations and sending a consolidated order to suppliers.', 'Accordingly, we have adapted our logistics organization with three distribution centers in Uruguay, Switzerland and Hong Kong, which operate additional warehouses in Hong Kong, Runnymede UK, Barcelona Spain and Miami USA and provide the timely shipping of goods to our operations.', 'The process benefits both Dufry and suppliers, as it allows us to order and ship larger volumes to the distribution centers, thus in creasing flexibility in product allocation by shop and maximize product availability.', 'Why Dufry LOGISTICS As a global retailer, present in over locations in countries, we fully recognize the vital importance of logistics in getting close to more customers, and en suring our daytoday and longterm success.', 'Taking logistics to the next level Our logistics network is based on regional distribu tion centers based in Europe, America and Asia.', 'From the Distribution Centers products are distributed to all the airports in which Dufry operates stores either directly or through a network of country warehouses.', 'In order to adapt our service to the wide variety of operation sizes and locations we supply goods through different distribution channels direct shipments from vendors, deliveries from our own stock in the distribu tion centers, cross docking etc.', ', minimizing the order ing cycle lead time and optimizing logistics costs and inventory levels in our distribution network.', 'At the same time, we lead collaborative planning and total supply chain optimization initiatives with all our main suppliers.', 'Through all these initiatives we jointly work to improve the endtoend supply chain in terms of lead times, products availability, logistic costs and inventory levels.', 'A thorough logistics plan has been defined to ensure our logistics are “best in class” in the travel retail en vironment.', 'In order to follow up on improvements on a weekly basis, we globally control the main key performance indicators at distribution center and retailer level including: levels and quality of the inventory; out of stocks; total ordering cycle leadtime, from our sup pliers to our distribution centers and from the distri bution centers to the retailers, as well as the costs of the total supply chain as well as inventory levels and quality.', 'Suppliers benefit from Dufrys centralized purchasing logistics The worldwide geographic footprint and the central ization of global functions generating efficiencies are two core elements of Dufrys business model.', 'The cen tralized purchasing and the logistics functions gener ate a variety of benefits for suppliers, which include not only monetary efficiencies but also ensure supe rior service levels for the endcustomer.', 'This also includes the ordering process itself, where Dufry transmits one consolidated order to suppliers, after having internally aggregated the orders of the individual locations.', 'In order to support our activities in countries and still ben efit from being a single group, Dufry has set up three supply chain regional organizations: One in Uruguay, one in Switzerland and one in Hong Kong, which also operate centralized logistics and warehousing plat forms in Hong Kong, Miami USA, Barcelona E and Runnemede UK.', 'Suppliers can thus efficiently ship larger units to our logistics platforms, while Dufry can better manage individual shop supply, ensuring im proved product availability for customers and thus ul timately improving sales.', 'Why Dufry IT SOLUTIONS Dufry

we achieve through the combi nation of sourcing unique product choices, providing attractive shopping environments and offering spe cial shopping experiences.', 'The traditional price value proposition has been enhanced with additional elements, as consumers today demand higher stan dards of sustainability from retailers.', 'From privacy and data protection, to responsible marketing and

Roadmap towards environmental sustainability was a milestone year in Dufry´s environmental footprint, as specific efforts carried out in the past by individual operations are now orchestrated sys tematically and aggregated at Group level.', 'Striving towards improving our environmental footprint, we have taken the necessary first steps to build our en vironmental sustainability strategy on these solid foundations.', 'The established environmental management system permits Dufry to assess and understand its impact on the environment with a systematic and consistent ap proach, subsequently enabling the company to define the main lines of our goals and actions.', 'In some ar eas, where we have direct and stronger possibilities to influence our footprint, we have already actioned specific initiatives to reduce our footprint, such as the replacement of plastic bags see page .', 'In other circumstances, where our business model provides less potential of directly influencing our footprint, Dufry significantly increases its stakeholder dialogue mainly with the airports and supply chain to ex plore opportunities to reduce the impact further.', 'Likewise, as a pure re tailer, Dufry does not develop own product labels, does not operate any own manufacturing sites, and only sells thirdparty products directly sourced from its brand partners.', 'The company therefore concentrates its energysav ing and emission reduction efforts mainly in the ar eas of supply chain logistics, its own office prem ises and in the planning of new stores or in the refurbishment efforts of existing shops.', 'With respect to shopdesign, the focus is on the related construc tion materials, fitting equipment and lighting in ac cordance with several sustainability criteria.', 'Addi tionally, Dufry takes part in industrywide initiatives such as the ACI Europe Climate Task Force, geared to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and it closely collaborates with local airport departments in their efforts to reduce and offset emissions.', 'Dufry´s environmental management As a signatory member of the UN Global Compact, Dufry has formally adopted the precautionary ap proach principle to its operations.', 'The company fol lows a consistent process to assess its operations from an environmental perspective, to identify cur rent or future environmental impacts of its activities and to promote initiatives that respect the environ mental balance and comply with existing environmen tal laws and regulations.', 'In this regard, in we have conducted construc tive dialogue with stakeholders in the areas in which we can actively influence the environmental footprint, to assess the impact and eventually implement mea sures to minimize or even to offset the impact.', 'As a first step, we have mapped our C emissions across Looking forward our supply chain and set up the structure to gather emissionrelated information in a consistent manner.', 'The boundary for Dufrys area of responsibility for emissions and its related CO footprint, covers im pacts generated from the moment our suppliers de liver their products to our distribution centers and warehouses, until the point at which we sell the prod ucts in the stores.', 'Our scope also includes the stores and the respec tive office and management buildings.', 'Whilst the current scope of the data gathering does not yet cover all locations, it provides first valuable insights towards building a robust environmental management system and strategy.', 'The data gather Resource consumption and CO footprint To better assess and understand the environmental impact of Dufry´s activity when it comes to resource consumption and emissions, we have identified four different areas of our business that permit the com pany to track and, in a second stage, implement the necessary measures and goals to minimize the im pact.', 'With respect to the types of resources used and the information collected, electricity and fuel consump tion are the most material aspects of our footprint; water consumption is marginal and restricted to nor mal use by our employees and cleaning services within our premises.', 'TRANSPORTATION CYCLE SUPPLIERS DISTRIBUTION CENTERS The delivery of products to Dufry´s premises is handled by the suppliers DUFRY STORES LOCAL WAREHOUSES Looking forward Stores Most of the electric energy consumption of Dufry´s activity happens in the store environment.', 'Lighting, refrigeration and air conditioning of over , stores are the largest contributors to our energy consump tion and, consequently, to our CO footprint.', 'Based on the utility invoices issued by landlords for the year , we have identified emissions and re source consumption for operations covering % of our global sales, including some of Dufry´s largest op erations the UK, Spain, Brazil or Mexico.', 'This scope will be further extended in by adding more gran ularity and additional locations, where possible.', 'In this context it is important to understand that in sev eral locations, the utility invoices from landlords pro vide a combined charge by squaremeter, which does not allow identification of specific amounts of single resources used and more specifically to isolate elec tricity consumption, thus this part of the business is currently not covered.', 'Distribution centers and warehouses The secondlargest contributor to Dufry´s environ mental footprint is the transportation of goods.', 'Dufry operates four major warehouses located in Barcelona SP, serving Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Russia; Runnymede UK for the UK market; Hong Kong, serving Asia and Australia, and a fourth one in Miami US for our operations in the US and Canada, as well as in Central and South America.', 'These main logistics centers receive major shipments from the suppliers and further distribute products to our respective operations.', 'Whenever possible, freight is carried by sea and we aim to consistently select the most efficient means of transport in terms of CO emissions.', 'Furthermore, the vast majority of our longhaul logistic partners are either ISO ac credited and or have strong environmental manage ment procedures in place.', 'Additionally, we have over local warehouses, which redistribute goods received from the central ware houses to the operations.', 'These are located where Dufry holds several significant operations within the same country in terms of volumes transported.', 'In general, distribution to individual stores is done by road.', 'These road transports are mostly outsourced to national and international specialized partners, some of which have implemented their own environ mental strategies.', 'Through the high efficiency in our logistics chain, we ensure that the environmental impact of transporting goods is kept to a minimum.', 'The vast majority of shipments of goods from the suppliers site to Dufrys Distribution Centers is ex cluded from the assessment, as these emissions lie within the ESG responsibility of the suppliers.', 'Office environment Beyond stores and warehouses, Dufry has office premises in a number of operations across the world.', 'Main ones include the Group´s Headquarter offices in Basel CH, Bedfont Lakes in Feltham UK, Madrid ESP, East Rutherford US, Miami US and Rio de Janeiro BR.', 'Within these premises, energy con sumption is mostly related to lighting and heating.', 'A number of individual measures, such as automatic switch off for lighting and heating systems, presence detector activators and staff awareness campaigns, have been implemented in Dufry offices to reduce utility consumption.', 'Additionally, we advise our em ployees to assess the overall necessity of any travel and consider using alternatives to travel, such as vir tual meeting systems videoconferences, teleconfer ences, computer live meetings, etc.', 'and we promote more environmental alternatives for our employees daily commuting, such as public transport offers.', 'Greenhouse Gas Protocol Dufry follows the Greenhouse Gas Protocol GHGP standards to report CO emissions.', 'This protocol is the most widely used international accounting tool for governments and businesses to understand, quantify and manage greenhouse gas emissions and classifies emissions into three scopes.', 'Scope : Direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources owned by the company.', 'For Dufry, Scope emissions are limited to those from the fuel used by Dufrymanaged transportation fleets and fossil fu els used mainly for heating purposes.', 'In the case of Dufry these include electricity consumption in stores, offices and ware houses.', 'Looking forward DUFRY EMISSIONS MAPPING DUFRY OFFICES DISTRIBUTION CENTERS

shopping bags Starting in the last quarter of , Dufry gradually began replacing plastic carrier bags at all its duty free operations globally, with more environmentally friendly ones made of compostable and recyclable materials.', 'For this type of bag, Dufry is also exploring recyclable or degradable al ternatives that will meet ICAO´s and airports´ regu lations.', 'Once the substitution of the singleuse plas tic bags is fully completed, the company will reduce plastic usage by .', 'The singleuse plastic bag phaseout is coupled with pointofsale communication campaigns to raise awareness and encourage customers to reduce sin gleuse plastic consumption and replace it with more sustainable alternatives.', 'The company has also agreed to adopt a global price scheme for carrier bags as an additional way of raising awareness and reducing plastic consumption overall.', 'This formal decommissioning of singleuse plastic carrier bags follows other measures adopted in pre vious years, geared at reducing plastic consump tion across our operations, such as offering more sustainable alternatives, including reusable or jute bags.', 'Waste and recycling Avoiding any waste in the first place or recycling it, is an effective way to save valuable resources.', 'In our warehouses, packaging materials, which mainly con sist of cardboard, paper, plastic film and wood, as well as electronic and plastic consumables such as neon lamps and PET, are sorted into different containers and sent for recycling.', 'The recycling process is out sourced to specialized service providers.', 'In the shops, waste produced by our operations is mostly packing material handled through the land lords waste disposal system and recycled accord ingly where possible.', 'In many of our locations, we are taking measures to reduce singleuse plastics film, such as replacing roll containers used to move prod ucts from warehouses to the stores.', 'The new mod els, which include closures on four sides and at the top, drastically reduce consumption of the plastic film needed for the covering and the plastic shrink wrapping used with the old system.', 'With regard to cartons and pallets used to transport and protect products, Dufry reuses the same units as much as possible, thus consistently reducing con sumption of new resources.', 'Lastly, in our offices, the reduction of paper con sumption is one of our ongoing challenges.', 'Dufry has put in place local initiatives to reduce paper and other office material consumption, including tips to reduce paper usage, such as printing
