environmental and social issues and to contribute to the sustain able development of people, society and the Earth through its businesses built on a foundation of chemistry.', 'In this way, we aim to realize KAITEKI.', 'I also wish to express my profound gratitude to the healthcare professionals working tirelessly on the front lines to treat patients as well as the many others working to keep society running in this challenging time.', 'The negative impacts of the COVID pandemic—from economic damage to the lifestyle changes we have all been forced to make—have reached a previously unimaginable scale.', 'Innovating our workplaces to maintain stable operations while ensuring employee safety is therefore an urgent task.', 'Another discovery has been a renewed awareness of the role of chemistry in preventing the spread of infec tious disease.', 'Many of the MCC Groups businesses support the physical foundations of society, and the Group manufactures numerous industrial materials that are crucial to the stability of everyday life.', 'Since the start of the pandemic, many ideas have emerged within the company for ways to modify and apply these materials in order to create products that will help prevent the spread of infection, and we have successfully worked to quickly provide such products to society.', 'These achievements were driven by the desire of our employees to contribute to society in the midst of this global pandemic using the power of chemistry.', 'KAITEKI: KAITEKI means “the sustainable wellbeing of people, society and our planet Earth.” It is an original concept of the Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corporation Group that proposes a way forward in the sustainable development of society and the planet, in addition to serving as a guide for solving environmental and social issues.', 'Working to Realize KAITEKI At the same time, in addition to combating infectious disease, it is our responsibility as a chemical company to provide solutions to such global issues as climate change, natural resource and energy depletion, disparities Mitsubishi Chemical Sustainability Report in water and food resource distribution and problems caused by plastic waste.', 'The chemical industry today has been built by taking things produced in the natural world and, through manmade processes, using them to create products with added functionality at low cost and in high volume.', 'While this basic approach will remain the same, going forward, an additional focus on avoiding negative environmental impact will be indispensable.', 'To date, we have provided materials that are lighter than metals, such as plastics and carbon fiber, and thus helped improve automobile fuel economy and reduce CO emissions, but such efforts cannot fully eliminate emissions.', 'To help reduce atmospheric CO, a cause of climate change, MCC is taking part in ARPChem, a NEDO project aimed at realizing artificial photosynthesis in order to utilize CO as a source of carbon, a valuable raw material for chemical products.', 'Through this project, we are developing technologies to use sunlight to manufacture chemical products from CO and water.', 'To address problems caused by plastic waste, we have for some time been developing a variety of recycling technologies and biodegradable plastics made from renewable resources to reduce environmental burden as well as working with CLOMA and other external organizations to expand collaboration across value chains.', 'At present, however, most plastic is made from fossil fuels and, after use, either incinerated for heat recovery, emitting CO, or buried in landfills.', 'In April , MCC established the Circular Economy Department, dedi cated to promoting the realization of a circular economy that effectively uses finite resources to simultaneously realize sustainability and growth.', 'Going beyond simply recycling industrial materials, we will contribute to the realization of a carbonneutral society by controlling CO emissions over entire product life cycles.', 'However, I believe that, going forward, only chemical companies can save our planet.', 'MCC will put its full strength into confronting globalscale issues headon.', 'This is how we will realize KAITEKI.', 'Even as workstyles change, our people remain our greatest resource.', 'We have distilled these efforts into declarations under the title “Mitsubishi Chemical Has Decided” that we have published both within the Group and externally.', 'Even as the external environment and workstyles change, if each employee exercises their abilities to the fullest in the pursuit of the realization of KAITEKI, we will overcome the present challenging circumstances.', 'At the same time, social issues, including human rights issues, are growing increasingly pressing.', 'Resolving such issues and, beyond that, realizing KAITEKI, will require working in harmony with stakeholders.', 'MCC will marshal its full strength to contribute to the realization of KAITEKI through its businesses, which are built on a foundation of chemistry.', 'Mitsubishi Chemical Sustainability Report Aiming to Realize KAITEKI As a core
