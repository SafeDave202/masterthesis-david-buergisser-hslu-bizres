industrial activity, such as peripheral lands used for agriculture.', 'Our expectations on land management Mina Andaychagua Transforming the landscape through environmental leadership and innovation In the central mountains of the Peruvian Andes, lies the Andaychagua mine, part of Volcans Yauli Mining Unit, one of the worlds largest producers of zinc, lead and silver.', 'For a long time, Andaychaguas greenery was minimal.', 'While land rehabilitation was being practiced, general environmental awareness was a concern, with reports of discarded plastic bottles, used tyres and other waste materials littered across the site.', 'Now, all this has changed due to an innovative environmental initiative that has led to some creative employee engagement.', 'Andaychagua first worked to identify its top environmental risks.', 'This helps to embed environmental respect, responsibility, action and management throughout the business.', 'Next, the mine launched a comprehensive communication campaign to raise widespread environmental awareness.', 'It displayed posters providing information, colourful notices and performance indicators in the sites most visited areas.', 'Finally, Andaychagua launched a variety of contests to raise environmental awareness and support local charities, including: • An annual bottle cap collection contest, rewarding the team who collects the most plastic bottle caps, for donation to Tierra y Ser, a local environmental NGO, that sells the recyclable caps for donations to those in need.', 'Andaychaguas efforts have contributed to the provision of wheelchairs and crutches; and • An annual recycled art competition, where operational teams compete to take typical waste materials, such as used tyres, boots and containers, creating works of art, which are then installed around the site at various points of interest.', 'In addition to these initiatives, Andaychagua has invested in transforming the mine entrance area with over ,m of new vegetation, serving as a visual reminder to all workers of their collective responsibility for environmental performance and sustainability.', 'Andaychagua also constructed a site greenhouse using recycled materials.', 'While initially built to grow plants as environmental controls such as, ecofriendly plantbased oils for use in dust suppression, it has now become a relaxing sanctuary where employees can find a peaceful moment to de stress and reconnect with nature.', 'Glencore Sustainability Report Material topicsContact usAdditional InformationPerformance in briefContact

Australian mines are now adopting.', 'By early , Mangoola has rehabilitated over hectares of mined land restoring a range of vegetation communities on the shaped post mine landform during the last ten

and, at the end of its operational life cycle, the land transitions to a postmining land use.', 'We develop closure plans and financial estimates to complete this postmining restoration well before the end of operations, with financial assurance typically provided to government agencies prior to development or expansion.', 'In addition, our assets are required to develop closure plans that include social frameworks and to identify progressive rehabilitation targets to encourage reclamation of areas where operations have ceased prior to the overall closure of the asset.', 'In addition to managing environmental risks, our approach to closure includes progressing robust social transition planning that minimises impacts on our workforce, local suppliers and communities.', 'We undertake closure activities in areas where industrial activities have occurred and where, either entirely or partly, operations have completed.', 'During the year, we established a global closure planning working group to develop enhanced closurerelated governance.', 'The working group comprised of subject matter experts from all commodity departments and operating regions, as well as key corporate functions such as corporate communications and communities and human rights.', 'Our approach to closure planning recognises that limiting our environmental footprint from the outset of operations reduces closurerelated impacts and liabilities in the long term, and aligns with our commitment to source responsibly the commodities needed for our daily lives.', 'As such, our closure planning begins in an assets design phase and continually updated throughout its operational life, incorporating the principles of adaptive management.', 'External engagement We actively participated in the development and refinement of the ICMM Closure Maturity Framework, a tool for building a common understanding of closure concepts across an assets life cycle and across mining disciplines.', 'The Framework aligns with ICMMs Integrated Mine Closure Good Practice Guide.', 'During , we conducted pilot testing of the tool at six representative assets.', 'Next steps • Global rollout and
