to specific corporate level performance indicators collected through our global datagathering system, such as CO emissions, engagement index and investment in research and development, that serve as inputs for the model.', 'Our methodology uses internationally recognized databases, globally accepted impact measurement approaches, and academic research.', 'A GAMECHANGING APPROACH The results of our assessment guide us in maximizing our positive impacts and minimizing our negative impacts, and enable us to make better informed decisions.', 'If employee turnover is higher than optimal, for example, this framework demonstrates the financial impact of that turnover in terms of decreased productivity, increased administrative costs, and the societal impact caused by the associated loss of income.', 'Across our business, we encourage our managers to prioritize double positive actions that have the potential to add value both to society and SGS.', 'For example, we know that reducing electricity consumption saves money, which is good for business, and it also reduces CO emissions, which is good for the environment and local communities creating positive value for both SGS and society.', 'Quantifying our value to society helps us to identify our strengths and weaknesses on a micro level, as well as benchmark our overall macro performance.', 'We are confident that this will help us make better decisions and further increase our positive impacts on society.', '“ At SGS, we have embarked on a pioneering journey toward understanding all the positive and negative impacts we
