governance and managing risk Investments Technology solutions Reducing our footprint Our colleagues Philanthropy and community engagement Targets Memberships, certifications and signatories Independent assurance report A word from our Managing Partners On behalf of my fellow Managing Partners, I am pleased to introduce the Lombard Odier Group Sustainability Report.', 'We publish this report to outline our approach to sustainability for all of our stakeholders, illustrating how we manage our commercial, social and environmental impacts and deliver on our sustainability strategy.', 'We prepared this report in line with the Global Reporting Initiative GRI Standards, the most widely accepted global framework for sustainability reporting.', 'Yet, throughout this most testing of times, our entrepreneurial spirit has enabled us to take constructive approaches to new challenges as we worked hard to maintain the level of service our clients have come to expect from us.', 'Simultaneously, we have taken important steps to protect our colleagues health and ensure operational continuity.', 'While the crisis has severely affected economies and communities globally, it is the most vulnerable populations who have borne the brunt of the impact.', 'That is why, at the outset of the pandemic, we launched our Covid Relief Initiative through Fondation Lombard Odier to help those in difficulty.', 'The pandemic triggered the deepest recession in modern history, the recovery from which, we are convinced, must be sustainable.', 'If we are to truly “build back better”, we believe our economy must transition to a Circular, Lean, Inclusive and Clean CLIC economic model.', 'And, from new technologies to greater capital availability, we already see significant changes with the potential to accelerate this transition.', 'To that end, in , we launched two new highconviction strategies: Climate Transition and Natural Capital.', 'We are continuing to see growing interest from our clients in sustainable investment solutions.', 'As we work with our clients to optimise returns, we believe how we allocate assets contributes to the transition to a sustainable economy.', 'As wealth transfers between generations, younger people challenge and accelerate changes to traditional approaches to building investment portfolios, with a particular focus on sustainable investments. .', 'In November , we reaffirmed our commitment to helping deliver a sustainable future when Lombard Odier signed the United Nations Principles for Responsible Banking.', 'Delivering on this commitment will form part of our ongoing work to embed sustainability throughout our business at the strategic, portfolio and internal corporate levels.', 'We also joined the Circular Bioeconomy Alliance, which aims to drive transformational change towards a climate and naturepositive economy by connecting investors to sustainable, investable solutions.', 'And we entered into a partnership with the University of Oxford to foster research and teaching on sustainable finance and investment, focusing especially on climate change, circular economy and natural capital.', 'We work with our clients to optimise returns, and we believe that our asset allocation contributes to the transition to a sustainable economy underscored the importance of our efficient, highly secure, bespoke banking platform that we believe is essential to the responsible longterm management of a financial institution.', 'In the coming years, we will continue to upgrade our technology through innovation, digitalising our internal processes and offering our clients experiences of an even higher quality.', 'In Geneva, the construction of our new headquarters is forging ahead.', 'This venture reflects our confidence in the future and our desire to create a space that meets our clients and colleagues needs today and tomorrow.', 'We want to create a building that showcases our commitment to sustainability.', 'To achieve this, we are aiming for the highest possible sustainability standards and ensuring a holistic approach to every aspect of the construction.', 'We enter optimistic that the recovery from the Covid pandemic will be sustainable.', 'At Lombard Odier, we will continue to support our clients in achieving their financial goals as we promote the transition to the CLIC economic model that will ensure a sustainable tomorrow, both for ourselves and for generations to come.', 'We believe that sustainability is the investment philosophy that is most likely to bring the highest returns.', 'That is why we recommend that all our clients build their portfolios with sustainability in mind Frédéric Rochat Managing Partner Introduction At Lombard Odier, we believe that the Sustainability Revolution is no longer a mere ideal.', 'We see no development more significant nor urgent than the need for a fundamental redesign of our unsustainable economic model, a need underscored by the Covid pandemic that continues to ravage economies and communities worldwide.', 'This model is WILD: Wasteful, Idle, Lopsided and Dirty.', 'Moving from a WILD to a CLICTM economy Wasteful Idle Lopsided Dirty Circular Lean Inclusive Clean We must evolve and transition to a more sustainable, regenerative alternative: a future based on a Circular, Lean, Inclusive and Clean model.', 'And we are already in the midst of this transition, one that the financial sector is in a prime position to support through its power in allocating capital.', 'Below, we highlight a number of key transformations that will take place when we move from a WILD to a CLIC economic model.', 'We believe we must fundamentally rethink the way we live, produce and act, and that we must decouple our economic growth from its underlying, adverse environmental footprint and ensure our economy delivers broad and inclusive benefits for all stakeholders.', 'The sustainable CLIC economy reduces our dependence on evergreater extraction of mineral resources and recognises the value of the materials and components that comprise the products currently excluded from circular, sustainable models.', 'C

the novel coronavirus even more dangerous.', 'Many of those unable to work from home—who are disproportionately less affluent—were forced to assume a greater risk of infection.', 'Lombard Odier activated its longstanding Business Continuity Plan in early , first by restricting travel to and from our offices in Asia.', 'By midMarch, supported by our inhouse technology, % of our colleagues were safely working from home while ensuring business continuity and enabling us to remain close to our clients.', 'Thanks to our employees dedication and resilience, our relationships with our clients grew stronger as we faced the same challenges, even as the physical distance between us increased.', 'Indeed, we cannot ensure enduring success as a firm through improved operational efficiency and lasting partnerships without also making a positive contribution to all of our stakeholders, including our clients, colleagues, portfolio companies, local communities, NGOs, suppliers and academics.', 'It is, therefore, crucial that we understand the social, environmental and economic effects of our actions.', 'At the end of , Lombard Odiers total client assets stood at CHF billion.', 'Consequently, we believe we can positively influence a large proportion of the economy through our work.', 'As stated in our Code of Conduct and Shared Values, seven core values underpin

Stewardship This section refers to Lombard Odier Investment Managers LOIM, our asset management business.', 'We use investment stewardship to address, manage and mitigate companyspecific, systemic and marketrelated sustainability risks to deliver sustainable benefits for the economy, environment and society.', 'LOIMs stewardship approach is built on three pillars: integration, engagement and voting.', 'For all three pillars, LOIM incorporates The Oxford Martin Principles for Climate Conscious Investment, the recommendations of the Financial Stability Boards FSB Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures TCFD and emerging best practice on natural capital, as well as the more traditional core ESG considerations, into the heart of its overall stewardship activities.', 'As such, the stewardship of sustainability enables us to encourage companies to secure an orderly transition to a sustainable model and increase their resilience to climate change impacts.', 'Engagement on sustainability issues allows us to go beyond systematic data screening by testing, challenging and influencing a companys sustainability profile.', 'Therefore, we have set ourselves the goal of embedding an active dialogue with companies on sustainability issues as an integral part of our investment process.', 'We do this regardless of whether we are equity or fixedincome investors.', 'However, from the very beginning, we have taken a crossasset approach to building our sustainability analyses and tools.', 'We continue to prioritise active ownership with our equity holdings, as described above.', 'We seek to vote in line with our clients longterm interests.', 'The outcomes of the engagements influence our investment considerations, and we link our voting to engagement outcomes.', 'This ensures a circular, consistent stewardship approach.', 'The unique characteristics of this asset class lend themselves to dialogue on issues besides equity investments.', 'Leverage, liquidity and tailrisks are among the key topics, which become even more important for lowerrated issuers.', 'Our private client business is working to adopt many best practices adapted to the private banking business model.', 'In , we made significant progress on establishing an effective, robust compliance framework that will facilitate the delivery of engagement

decisions for over years and have developed our own proprietary models to ensure we benefit from the most robust, decisionrelevant information possible.', 'In turn, this enables us to better understand how companies are positioned with regard to the sustainability issues most pertinent to their longterm performance and to identify those achieving measurable results on the journey towards greater sustainability.', 'Implementation of sustainable investment internally managed funds At Lombard Odier, sustainability is a crossteam collaboration between our investment teams and dedicated sustainability experts.', 'This means that we use a blend of systematic and fundamental analysis at all levels of the investment process.', 'Over the past year, we have significantly expanded our

directly or through industry collaboration—to promote sustainable business practices and models and enhance longterm value for clients.', 'To reflect the complex and multifaceted nature of sustainability challenges, the team brings together sustainability specialists with a range of skillsets that include investment banking, macroeconomics, lifecycle analysis, data science, stewardship and communications.', 'We have an extensive quantitative platform that systematically gathers data on companies and key ESG issues.', 'During , we upgraded our proprietary ESG tool to filter the ESG issues that are most relevant to specific business contexts—commonly referred to as a ‘materiality based approach.', 'To achieve this, we created a proprietary framework encompassing dimensions that reflect the principal dimensions of ESG opportunities and risks to which companies can be exposed across their value chain.', 'We have identified and ranked the most material ESG dimensions for Global Industry Classification Standard GICS Level subindustries, which is captured in our proprietary Lombard Odier ESG Materiality Heat Map.', 'Using this methodology, we then calculate our Lombard Odier ESG Materiality Rating for each company, ranking them from A+ to D based on a comparison with their peers.', 'Our Lombard Odier ESG Materiality Rating also embeds our proprietary Consciousness, Actions and Results CAR methodology.', 'Since we believe that companies making measurable progress towards sustainability are more likely to outperform, we overweight the ‘Results component: ESG indicators linked to definitive outcomes.', '› › Our Lombard Odier ESG Materiality methodology enhances our ability to monitor companies progress on the sectorspecific issues that are the most relevant to their longterm sustainability and engage with them on these material issues.', 'The ESG solutions team has also built an inhouse model for assessing the sustainability of sovereign
