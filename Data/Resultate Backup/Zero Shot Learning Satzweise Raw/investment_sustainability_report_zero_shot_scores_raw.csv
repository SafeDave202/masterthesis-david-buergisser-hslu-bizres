Responsible Investing, Asset Management, Coutts TAKING RESPONSIBILITY At Coutts, we invest with purpose and integrity, and with a keen focus on sustainability.', 'And in the first of our annual sustainability reports, we show you how.', 'But we embed this thinking across our entire investment process and offering for all our clients.', 'So those who invest with us choose to fight against climate change, promote diversity and establish good working conditions for all.', 'And crucially, it doesnt cost you a penny more.', ""Defeating climate change, for example, isn't about what we believe, it's about what we do."", 'Inaction is not an option.', 'Only action will lead to a sustainable future.', 'At a climate change event we hosted for clients last year, broadcaster Sir David Attenborough told the audience the levers that needed pressing lay with them.', 'And as your indispensable partner, its vital that we help you.', 'SUSTAINABILITY REPORT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT FIVE REASONS TO BE RESPONSIBLE We all know having a sustainable and responsible approach to investing is important because it can build a better world and who doesnt want that?', 'YOU CAN HELP DISRUPT INDUSTRIES FOR THE BETTER YOU CAN SUPPORT INVESTMENT IN RESPONSIBLE COMPANIES Companies across the globe are making very real, very positive changes as a result of investor engagement.', 'For example, Climate Action +, an initiative we participate in which aims to reduce corporate greenhouse gas emissions, helped achieve the following: ◊ Nestlé committed to net zero emissions by ◊ Volkswagen committed to become ‘climate neutral by and to launch nearly electric vehicle models by ◊ Rio Tinto stopped mining coal and committed to an assetbyasset review to set emission reduction targets Any major change in society can lead to opportunities for investors.', 'At Coutts, were always looking for cases where positive environmental, social and governance ESG characteristics form part of a companys investment case.', 'An example is a US industrial gases company we recently bought shares in that provides technology to enable cleaner energy solutions in the Middle East and China.', 'These activities dramatically improved the companys profitability, helping drive annual earnings per share growth of % over the last five years.', 'WE CAN ADAPT QUICKLY WHEN THE RULES CHANGE IT HELPS YOU PRESERVE YOUR WEALTH FOR THE LONG TERM YOU CAN TAKE COMFORT IN KNOWING WE CARE ABOUT THE FUTURE £ With these issues discussed everywhere from Westminster to the World Economic Forum, its only a matter of time before regulators start formalising rules to ensure businesses do whats required.', 'At Coutts we believe we will be well placed if regulators harden their stance.', 'Weve set ambitious targets on the carbon emissions of our portfolios and funds a % reduction in our equity holdings by the end of and a % reduction in our overall holdings by and were awarded the highest possible rank for our responsible investing activities by the Financial Reporting Council at their last review in September .', 'Numerous studies show a strong link between responsible investing and investment performance.', 'But they also outperformed by the same amount in the first three months of , when conditions were less positive due to the COVID related selloff.', 'This makes perfect sense, because businesses that take it seriously can reduce risk and maximise opportunities by coming up with new, muchneeded ways to do things.', 'And it can all have a positive effect on the share price.', 'We have a long history of banking families for generations.', 'Everything we do for our clients, from helping them invest to supporting their wider financial planning needs, is designed to help them and their children prosper now and well into the future.', 'We understand that preserving and growing our clients wealth is not enough we also need to help create a better future for them to enjoy that

chains avoid unethical labour practices, and the health impact of its products.', 'This includes its accounting practices, how it negotiates with suppliers, its attitude to diversity and how it contributes to a fair and stable market environment.', 'SUSTAINABILITY This means achieving todays goals without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same.', 'In an investing context, it means striving to provide financial returns today without negatively impacting the environment and society over the longer term.', 'PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT PRI The worlds leading organisation on responsible investing, the PRI encourages investors to use responsible investment to enhance returns and better manage risks.', ""CLIMATE ACTION + A global body, run by five

stake, we need to be change makers on this, not change followers, even if that involves making hard choices.” MOHAMMAD KAMAL SYED, HEAD OF ASSET MANAGEMENT LETS BE DIRECT We work with independent organisations like Sustainalytics, a world leader in gathering ESG information, to assess the relevant risks and opportunities a company presents before we decide whether to invest in it directly.', 'The information comes in three categories: • • • unmanaged ESG risks how much risk related to ESG the company is exposed to and how well theyre managing it.', 'controversies they scan around , data

much less likely.” HOWARD SPARKS, SENIOR EQUITY SPECIALIST FUNDAMENTAL We work with the world's bestinclass specialist fund managers, who invest in a number of companies on our behalf, and make up a significant proportion of our client portfolios."", 'When selecting these funds, our thorough analysis of them their investment process and performance, and any risks includes assessing their approach to responsible investing.', 'We do this by sending them a responsible investing questionnaire, which asks them to go into detail on their policies, pledges and principles regarding responsible

to the Principles of Responsible Investment, the worlds top responsible investing body they vote at the annual general meetings AGMs of the companies they invest in.', 'As with our direct investments, we have a scoring system for our funds, and their record on responsible investing contributes to their final score.', 'We dont just stop thinking about the impact our investments have on the world once weve chosen which firms and funds to invest in.', 'We do this with EOS at Federated Hermes, which engages with companies on behalf of investors to encourage responsible behaviour.', 'EOS represents investors in countries with over £ billion in assets under advice as at March .', 'This was largely on board, structure and pay issues.', 'With funds, we review progress through regular reports and facetoface, annual reviews.', 'We also ask them to update our responsible investing questionnaire every year.', '“ Even though we like the companies we have in our portfolios, were not afraid to go against their management when we think its the right thing to do.” HOWARD SPARKS, SENIOR EQUITY SPECIALIST SUSTAINABILITY REPORT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT We dont just stop thinking about the

LONGER INVESTS IN COMPANIES OVERLY INVOLVED IN CLIMATEHARMING, COALRELATED ACTIVITIES After extensive research, we chose four key areas to exclude when deciding which businesses to invest in directly.', 'We did this because it helps protect the planet but also because, as support for coal based activity dwindles, companies that adopt it will come under increased pressure.', 'Already, as of September , more than , institutions have pledged to divest from fossil fuels, according to .org.', 'THERMAL COAL EXTRACTION AND THERMAL COAL ENERGY GENERATION Thermal coal, which is coal burnt in power stations to generate electricity, creates some of the highest levels of CO emissions compared to the energy it produces.', 'There is growing agreement among scientists that, to limit global warming to well below ° Celsius, a drastic phaseout of thermal coal is vital.', 'TAR SANDS Tar sands are a mixture of clay, sand, water and bitumen that are mined and refined into oil.', 'Crude oil from tar sands emits % more greenhouse gases than conventional oil.', 'We exclude any company that derives more than % of its revenue from involvement in tar sands.', 'ARCTIC OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION We believe that exploration of the Arctic is inherently unsustainable.', '“ Excluding these activities from our direct holdings is the smart thing to do as well as the sustainable thing to do.', 'We want to minimise our exposure to anything thats inherently unsustainable because we believe the growing push to protect the environment will ultimately impact the value of the companies involved.',
