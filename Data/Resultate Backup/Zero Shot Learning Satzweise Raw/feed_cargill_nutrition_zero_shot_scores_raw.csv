diet.', 'Seafood continues to own the health halo of Omegas.', 'Beyond personal health, consumers have concerns about animal welfare, antibiotic use and environmental impacts, which they also think of as health values and often believe to be intertwined with negative health impacts.', 'Consumers want to know the story of the food they are eating: Who made this food and where?', 'Did they deal fairly with the farmers and workers?', 'Were the animals treated humanely?', 'At Cargill, the idea of Healthy People encompasses these values, including how we support human health through our products.', 'It also addresses the health of the communities which we source from and operate in.', 'Our Supplier Code of Conduct reflects the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as
