time.', 'This overview summarizes the key scenario assessments and pilots conducted at UBS since , which we will build upon to deepen our understanding of climate risks and opportunities.', 'Our initial topdown approach consisted of a scenario based stress test to assess UBSs balance sheet vulnerability across the firm.', 'Leveraging our existing firmwide topdown stresstesting methodology, we developed a climate change scenario which assumes that severe weather events result in governments around the world agreeing to implement carbon pricing mechanisms to assess the impact on financial assets, operational income and physical assets.', 'The scenario anticipated that these mechanisms will prompt a shift away from coal and other fossil fuels to cleaner alternatives and adversely impact markets and gross domestic product.', 'Our subsequent bottomup analyses of oil and gas utilities as well as electric utilities loan portfolios consisted of a forwardlooking analysis to assess impacts of a longterm low fossil fuel price scenario resulting from policies promoting greater use of renewables, enhancing efficiency standards and limiting emissions.', 'From both topdown and bottomup approaches, our internal stress tests suggested no immediate threat to UBSs balance sheet.', 'However, we identified methodological challenges ranging from the suitability of climate scenarios for banking risk modeling to data availability.', 'Now entering its third iteration, our objective is to develop analytical tools to help banks define and disclose climaterelated risks and opportunities, as recommended by the TCFD.', 'This includes developing and standardizing how we quantify climaterelated risks, addressing data gaps in the process, including Parisaligned scenarios, and further refining scenariobased stresstesting methodologies.', 'These advancements aim for banks to more robustly identify and disclose exposure to climaterelated risks and opportunities.', 'The methodology combines quantitative bottomup borrowerlevel analysis with topdown portfolio segmentation, to analyze for creditrating impacts under a degree climate scenario.', 'The main results showed minimal impacts to UBS, primarily due to the financial strength of our borrowers and the ability for them to adapt to climaterelated policy and technology risks.', 'Counterparties in UBSs portfolio were quantitatively analyzed based on the narrative that a high carbon price under the climate scenarios would result in reduced revenue from high carbonbased assets e.g., coalfired power plants.', 'Meanwhile, lowcarbon capital expenditure would increase as these companies invest in renewable technologies to maintain production capacity.', 'Capital would be raised based on a mixture of debt and equity, based on the companies capital structure today.', 'Increased revenues from the renewable capacity would offset lost revenues.', 'Most of UBSs counterparties tested at the time were investment
