0,sustainability,"Sustainability is a societal goal that broadly aims for humans to safely co-exist on Earth over a long time. Specific definitions of sustainability are difficult to agree on and therefore vary in the literature and over time. The concept of sustainability can be used to guide decisions at the global, national and individual level (e.g. sustainable living). Sustainability is commonly described along the lines of three dimensions (also called pillars): environmental, economic and social. Many publications state that the environmental dimension (also referred to as ""planetary integrity"" or ""ecological integrity"") should be regarded as the most important one. Accordingly, in everyday usage of the term, sustainability is often focused on the environmental aspects. The most dominant environmental issues since around  have been climate change, loss of biodiversity, loss of ecosystem services, land degradation, and air and water pollution. Humanity is now exceeding several ""planetary boundaries"".A closely related concept is that of sustainable development. The terms are often used synonymously. UNESCO formulated a distinction as follows: ""Sustainability is often thought of as a long-term goal (i.e. a more sustainable world), while sustainable development refers to the many processes and pathways to achieve it."" Both concepts have been criticized. One such criticism is that the concept is vague, ill-defined and merely a buzzword. Another is that sustainability as a goal might be impossible to reach; it has been pointed out that ""no country is delivering what its citizens need without transgressing the biophysical planetary boundaries"".:  How the economic dimension of sustainability should be addressed is controversial. Scholars have discussed this aspect under the concept of ""weak and strong sustainability"". For example, there will always be tension between the ideas of ""welfare and prosperity for all"" and environmental conservation. Therefore, trade-offs are required. Approaches that decouple economic growth from environmental deterioration would be desirable but are difficult to implement.There are many barriers to achieving sustainability, which must be addressed for a ""sustainability transition"" to become possible.:   Some sustainability barriers arise from nature and its complexity. Other barriers are ""extrinsic"" to the concept of sustainability. A number of extrinsic sustainability barriers are related to the dominant institutional frameworks where market mechanisms often fail to create public goods. Some example steps humanity can take to transition to environmental sustainability include: maintaining nature's ecosystem services, reducing food waste, promoting dietary shifts towards plant-based foods, further reducing fertility rates and thus population growth, promoting new green technologies and adopting renewable energy sources while phasing out subsidies to energy production through fossil fuels. Global issues are difficult to tackle as they would require global solutions. However, existing global organizations (UN, WTO and others) are inefficient in enforcing current global regulation for example due to the lack of suitable sanctioning mechanisms.: –This is a bibliography of sustainability publications.The history of environmental pollution traces human-dominated ecological systems from the earliest civilizations to the present day. This history is characterized by the increased regional success of a particular society, followed by crises that were either resolved, producing sustainability, or not, leading to decline. In early human history, the use of fire and desire for specific foods may have altered the natural composition of plant and animal communities. Between , and , years ago, agrarian communities emerged which depended largely on their environment and the creation of a ""structure of permanence.""The Western industrial revolution of the th to th centuries tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. In the mid-th century, a gathering environmental movement pointed out that there were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed. In the late th century, environmental problems became global in scale. The  and  energy crises demonstrated the extent to which the global community had become dependent on non-renewable energy resources. By the s, the ecological footprint of humanity exceeded the carrying capacity of earth, therefore the mode of life of humanity became unsustainable. In the st century, there is increasing global awareness of the threat posed by global climate change, produced largely by the burning of fossil fuels. Another major threat is biodiversity loss, caused primarily by land use change.The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to sustainability:
Sustainability – capacity to endure. For humans, sustainability is the long-term maintenance of well being, which has environmental, economic, and social dimensions, and encompasses the concept of stewardship and responsible resource management.MyCiTy is a Maryland-based (c)() non-profit organization that promotes environmental sustainability through the diversion of potential food waste. MyCiTy was founded in  by Christopher Dipnarine with a major focus on reducing food waste and limiting the harmful effects caused by organic waste on our environmental while improving food security for families within the communities.The Amsterdam Global Conference on Sustainability and Transparency was held for the third time in May . Over the years, the conference has seen the world’s largest gathering of leaders, thinkers and doers in the field of sustainability reporting, with debates being convened  on how reporting can be used to help build a better future. Thought leaders from business, finance, government and civil society have been brought together to debate the political, strategic and practical choices confronting the world and expert practitioners have led workshops and interactive sessions to define the building blocks of more effective reporting.The first Amsterdam Global Conference on Sustainability and Transparency, held by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), took place in October , with over , participants. In May , the second Amsterdam Global Conference was held. This climate neutral conference brought together over , participants from  countries. The  Amsterdam Global Conference on Sustainability and Transparency was held from – May  at the Amsterdam RAI Exhibition and Convention Centre in The Netherlands.The term anthroposystem is used to describe the anthropological analogue to the ecosystem. In other words, the anthroposystem model serves to compare the flow of materials through human systems to those in naturally occurring systems.  As defined by Santos, an anthroposystem is ""the orderly combination or arrangement of physical and biological environments for the purpose of maintaining human civilization...built by man to sustain his kind.""  The anthroposystem is intimately linked to economic and ecological systems as well.Anti-consumerism is a sociopolitical ideology that is opposed to consumerism, the continual buying and consuming of material possessions.  Anti-consumerism is concerned with the private actions of business corporations in pursuit of financial and economic goals at the expense of the public welfare, especially in matters of environmental protection, social stratification, and ethics in the governing of a society. In politics, anti-consumerism overlaps with environmental activism, anti-globalization, and animal-rights activism; moreover, a conceptual variation of anti-consumerism is post-consumerism, living in a material way that transcends consumerism.Anti-consumerism arose in response to the problems caused by the long-term mistreatment of human consumers and of the animals consumed, and from the incorporation of consumer education to school curricula; examples of anti-consumerism are the book No Logo () by Naomi Klein, and documentary films such as The Corporation (), by Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott, and Surplus: Terrorized into Being Consumers (), by Erik Gandini; each made anti-corporate activism popular as an ideologically accessible form of civil and political action.
The criticism of economic materialism as a dehumanizing behaviour that is destructive to Earth, as human habitat, comes from religion and social activism. The religious criticism asserts that materialist consumerism interferes with the connection between the individual and God, and so is an inherently immoral style of life; thus the German historian Oswald Spengler (–) said that, ""Life in America is exclusively economic in structure, and lacks depth."" From the Roman Catholic perspective, Thomas Aquinas said that, ""Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things""; in that vein, Francis of Assisi, Ammon Hennacy, and Mohandas Gandhi said that spiritual inspiration guided them towards simple living.
From the secular perspective, social activism indicates that from consumerist materialism derive crime (which originates from the poverty of economic inequality), industrial pollution and the consequent environmental degradation, and war as a business.
About the societal discontent born of malaise and hedonism, Pope Benedict XVI said in  that the philosophy of materialism offers no purpose for human existence, and in  specifically attacked the commercialization of Christmas; likewise, the writer Georges Duhamel said that ""American materialism [is] a beacon of mediocrity that threatened to eclipse French civilization"".Applied sustainability is the application of science and innovation, including the insights of the social sciences, to meet human needs while indefinitely preserving the life support systems of the planet.
Note that this is a significant difference from the standard definition of sustainability that normally is encapsulated by some version of the Brundtland Commission's concept:  “development that meets the needs and aspirations of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”Artificial leather, also called synthetic leather, is a material intended to substitute for leather in upholstery, clothing, footwear, and other uses where a leather-like finish is desired but the actual material is cost 
prohibitive or unsuitable. Artificial leather is known under many names, including leatherette, imitation leather, faux leather, vegan leather, PU leather, and pleather.The biocapacity or biological capacity of an ecosystem is an estimate of its production of certain biological materials such as natural resources, and its absorption and filtering of other materials such as carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.Biocapacity is used together with ecological footprint as a method of measuring human impact on the environment. Biocapacity and ecological footprint are tools created by the Global Footprint Network, used in sustainability studies around the world.
Biocapacity is expressed in terms of global hectares per person, thus is dependent on human population. A global hectare is an adjusted unit that represents the average biological productivity of all productive hectares on Earth in a given year (because not all hectares produce the same amount of ecosystem services). Biocapacity is calculated from United Nations population and land use data, and may be reported at various regional levels, such as a city, a country, or the world as a whole. 
For example, there were roughly . billion hectares of biologically productive land and water areas on this planet in . Dividing by the number of people alive in that year, . billion, gives a biocapacity for the Earth of . global hectares per person. These . global hectares includes the areas for wild species that compete with people for space.The Biomimicry Institute is a (c)() not-for-profit organization founded in  that empowers people to seek nature-inspired solutions for a healthy planet. To advance the solution process, the Institute offers AskNature.org, a free online tool that contains strategies found in nature and examples of ways they are used in design. It also hosts a Youth Design Challenge to support project-based education; a Biomimicry Launchpad startup accelerator program; and the Ray of Hope Prize® for early-stage biomimetic companies to bring solutions to market. In , the Institute launched a new collaborative initiative called Design for Decomposition which will pilot technologies that convert discarded clothes and textiles into biocompatible raw materials.
The organization is based in Missoula, Montana in the United States. Its goal is to help innovators learn from nature in order to design sustainable products, processes, and policies in response to real-world problems. The Biomimicry Institute has become a key communicator in the field of biomimetics, connecting thousands of practitioners and organizations across the world. Its Global Network currently supports  regional networks across  countries as of .
The Biomimicry Institute was founded in  by Bryony Schwan, Dayna Baumeister and Janine Benyus
and originated following the publishing of Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature by Janine Benyus; a natural sciences writer, innovation consultant and author.Blended finance is defined ""as the strategic use of development finance and philanthropic funds to mobilize private capital flows to emerging and frontier markets"", resulting in positive results for both investors and communities. Blended finance offers the possibility to scale up commercial financing for developing countries and to channel such financing toward investments with development impact. As such, blended finance is designed to support progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations. Meeting the SDGs will require an additional $. trillion in private and public financing per year as of  estimates, and an additional $. trillion to implement the COP Paris climate accord. The concept of blended finance can contribute to raising the private financing needed. It was first recognized as a solution to the funding gap in the outcome document of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in July .Building upon evidence from a previous survey done on behalf of the World Economic Forum, the OECD released recent findings which identified  blended finance funds and facilities, with $. billion in assets invested across  developing countries and impacting over  million lives, demonstrating the tremendous potential of blended finance to close the funding gap required to finance the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agenda and deliver development outcomes.
The concept has been gaining popularity lately within the world of international development finance. As a result, blended finance principles have been adopted by the Development Assistance Committee to guide the design and implementation of the concept, which aims to use development finance, including philanthropic resources, to align additional finance towards meeting the SDGs.Paul-Marie Boulanger is a Belgian sociologist active in the study of sustainable development and consumption.BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method), first published by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in , is the world's longest established method of assessing, rating, and certifying the sustainability of buildings.  More than , buildings have been 'BREEAM-certified' and over two million are registered for certification in more than  countries worldwide. BREEAM also has a tool which focuses on neighbourhood development.Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) is the process of capturing carbon dioxide (CO) to be recycled for further usage. Carbon capture and utilization may offer a response to the global challenge of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major stationary (industrial) emitters. CCU differs from carbon capture and storage (CCS) in that CCU does not aim nor result in permanent geological storage of carbon dioxide. Instead, CCU aims to convert the captured carbon dioxide into more valuable substances or products; such as plastics, concrete or biofuel; while retaining the carbon neutrality of the production processes.
Captured CO can be converted to several products: one group being alcohols, such as methanol, to  use as biofuels and other alternative and renewable sources of energy. Other commercial products include plastics, concrete and reactants for various chemical synthesis.Although CCU does not result in a net carbon positive to the atmosphere, there are several important considerations to be taken into account. Because CO is a thermodynamically stable form of carbon manufacturing products from it is energy intensive. The availability of other raw materials to create a product should also be considered before investing in CCU.
Considering the different potential options for capture and utilization, research suggests that those involving chemicals, fuels and microalgae have limited potential for CO removal, while those that involve construction materials and agricultural use can be more effective.The profitability of CCU depends partly on the carbon price of CO being released into the atmosphere.Complementary architecture is a movement in contemporary architecture promoting architectural practice rooted in comprehensive understanding of context, aiming to contribute to the environment in such a way as to continue and improve or emphasise its preexisting qualities. Indispensable features of complementary architecture include sustainability, altruism, contextualism, endemism and continuity of specific regional design language.The word complement has roots in the Latin complementum, from complēre to fill up, complete and remains true to that origin in its spelling and in its meanings that have to do with completing or fulfilment.Complementary architecture occurs at the intersection of local pattern and design languages. A pattern language represents a set of more or less formalised rules of human interaction with built forms, resulting from practical solutions developed over time according to local culture and natural conditions. A design language in architecture is a set of geometrical (formal) and material standards used in buildings and other man-made structures, traditionally arising from local materials and their physical properties.Complementary architecture interprets the Vitruvian triad for contemporary use, mapping durability (firmitas) against aspects of broader sustainability, utility (utilitas) against altruism and service to society, and individual beauty (venustas) against harmony with broader context, regional identity and spirit of place.Convergence in sustainability sciences refers to mechanisms and pathways that lead towards sustainability with a specific focus on 'Equity within biological planetary limits'. These pathways and mechanisms explicitly advocate equity and recognise the need for redistribution of the Earth's resources in order for human society to operate enduringly within the Earth's biophysical limits.
The term was first introduced by Phillip A. Sharp and Robert Langer in  in the context of biomedical science. They called for a problem-solving approach that integrated knowledge from the fields of engineering, the physical sciences, computer science, and the life sciences to find solutions to human problems.  The idea has since been applied in areas including climate change, environmental health, public health, systemic inequities. and sustainability.  One strategy is to add “friction” to undesirable practices and make them harder to do, while making the desired practices “frictionless” or easy to do.This use of the term 'convergence' harkens from the concept of contraction and convergence (C&C), taking its core principles of Equity and Survival and applying them beyond the frame of greenhouse gas emissions to the wider sustainability agenda.


== References ==Convergence Festival is an annual sustainable living festival held in Ireland.  Running since , and organised by the Sustainable Ireland Cooperative Society, the festival features a combination of events relating to sustainable development.Convergence research aims to solve complex problems employing transdisciplinarity. While academic disciplines are useful for identifying and conveying coherent bodies of knowledge, some problems require collaboration among disciplines, including both enhanced understanding of scientific phenomena as well as resolving social issues. The two defining characteristics of convergence research include: ) the nature of the problem, and ) the collaboration among disciplines.Cornucopianism is the idea that continued progress and provision of material items for mankind can be met by similarly continued advances in technology. It relies on the belief that there is enough matter and energy on the Earth to provide for the population of the world, appears adequate to give humanity almost unlimited room for growth.The term comes from the cornucopia, the ""horn of plenty"" of Greek mythology, which magically supplied its owners with endless food and drinks.  Adherents are called ""cornucopians"" or sometimes ""boomsters"", in contrast to doomers, whose views are more aligned with Malthusianism.""Cosmopolitan localism or Cosmolocalism is a social innovation approach to community development that seeks to link local and global communities through resilient infrastructures that bring production and consumption closer together, building on distributed systems. The concept of cosmopolitan localism was pioneered by Wolfgang Sachs, a scholar in the field of environment, development, and globalization. Sachs is known as one of the many followers of Ivan Illich and his work has influenced the green and ecological movements. Contrary to glocalisation, cosmolocalism moves from locality to universality, acknowledging the local as the locus of social co-existence and emphasizing the potential of global networking beyond capitalist market rules.Cosmopolitan localism fosters a global network of mutually supportive communities (neighbourhoods, villages, towns, cities and regions) who share and exchange knowledge, ideas, skills, technology, culture and (where socially and ecologically sustainable) resources. The approach seeks to foster a creative, reciprocal relationship between the local and the global. Cosmopolitan localism aims to address problems that emerge from globalization—namely, the subsuming of local cultures and economies into a homogenised and unsustainable global system—while simultaneously avoiding the pitfalls of localization, such as parochialism and isolationism.The self-organization of people with access to the fostered global network, collaborate and produce shared resources and their own governance systems. This system is built around a commons and entails the social practices of creating and governing a resource through the institutions that a community of producers or users creates and manages. They manifest in various formats, from the co-management of natural resources (e.g., fisheries, pastures) to the co-creation and co-management of digitally shared content. Initiatives such as the free encyclopedia Wikipedia, which has displaced the corporate-organized Encyclopedia Britannica and Microsoft Encarta, and the Apache HTTP Server, the leading software in the web-server market, have exemplified digital commons. The beginning of commons almost exclusively contained digital forms of virtual projects and communities. The later movements of commons have now also included local manufacturing and the entanglement between analog and digital technologies across natural and digital commons, physical and digital spaces, activities, and time.Italian social innovation scholar Ezio Manzini describes cosmopolitan localism as having the potential to generate a new sense of place. With cosmopolitan localism, places are not considered isolated entities, but nodes in short-distance and long-distance networks which globally link local communities in distributed networks of shared exchange, bringing production and consumption closer together. The short-distance networks generate and regenerate the local socio-economic fabric and the long-distance networks connect a particular community to the rest of the world. This form of cosmolocalism is rooted in an emerging productive model that is based on the concept of the digital commons and the motto ""design global, manufacture local"" (DGML).Cosmopolitan localism is a topic of focus for transition designers who explore design-led societal transition toward more sustainable futures. Others have argued that cosmolocalism advances alternatives that could potentially undermine dominant capitalist imaginary significations, attitudes and modalities. It can lead the way for a transition towards a post-capitalist, commons-centric economy and society where value is collectively created and accessible to all. In order for cosmolocalism to become more than a blueprint for a mode of production, the autonomy of local communities and individuals is essential.Cultural sustainability as it relates to sustainable development (or to sustainability), has to do with maintaining cultural beliefs, cultural practices, heritage conservation, culture as its own entity, and the question of whether or not any given cultures will exist in the future. From cultural heritage to cultural and creative industries, culture is both an enabler and a driver of the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. Culture is defined as a set of beliefs, morals, methods, institutions and a collection of human knowledge that is dependent on the transmission of these characteristics to younger generations. Cultural sustainability has been categorized under the social pillar of the three pillars of sustainability, but some argue that cultural sustainability should be its own pillar, due to its growing importance within social, political, environmental, and economic spheres. The importance of cultural sustainability lies within its influential power over the people, as decisions that are made within the context of society are heavily weighed by the beliefs of that society.Cultural sustainability can be regarded as a fundamental issue, even a precondition to be met on the path towards sustainable development. However, the theoretical and conceptual understanding of cultural sustainability within the general frames of sustainable development remains vague. And consequently, the role of culture is poorly implemented in the environmental, as well as political and social policy. Determining the impact of cultural sustainability is found by investigating the concept of culture in the context of sustainable development, through multidisciplinary approaches and analyses. This means examining the best practices for bringing culture into political and social policy as well as practical domains, and developing means and indicators for assessing the impacts of culture on sustainable development.De Ceuvel is a former shipyard in North Amsterdam, repurposed as a circular office park. Former houseboats hoisted onto the land are used as workspaces and ateliers for various creative and sustainable initiatives. Plants purify the polluted soil through phytoremediation and the terrain is used for various experiments with clean technologies. The terrain has a bed-and-breakfast and a cafe-restaurant which is famous for its sustainable approach.Degrowth (French: décroissance) is a term used for both a political, economic, and social movement as well as a set of theories that critique the paradigm of economic growth. It can be described as an extensive framework that is based on critiques of the growth-centered economic system in which we are living. Degrowth is based on ideas from a diverse range of lines of thought such as political ecology, ecological economics, feminist political ecology, and environmental justice, pointing out the social and ecological harm caused by the pursuit of infinite growth and Western ""development"" imperatives. Degrowth emphasizes the need to reduce global consumption and production (social metabolism) and advocates a socially just and ecologically sustainable society with social and environmental well-being replacing GDP as the indicator of prosperity. Hence, although GDP is likely to shrink in a ""Degrowth society"", i.e. a society in which the objectives of the degrowth movement are achieved, this is not the primary objective of degrowth. The main argument of degrowth advocates is that an infinite expansion of the economy is fundamentally contradictory to finite planetary boundaries.
Degrowth highlights the importance of autonomy, care work, self-organization, commons, community, open localism, work sharing, happiness and conviviality.Direct air capture (DAC) is a process of capturing carbon dioxide (CO) directly from the ambient air (as opposed to capturing from point sources, such as a cement factory or biomass power plant) and generating a concentrated stream of CO for sequestration or utilization or production of carbon-neutral fuel and windgas. Carbon dioxide removal is achieved when ambient air makes contact with chemical media, typically an aqueous alkaline solvent or sorbents. These chemical media are subsequently stripped of CO through the application of energy (namely heat), resulting in a CO stream that can undergo dehydration and compression, while simultaneously regenerating the chemical media for reuse.
DAC was suggested in  by Klaus S. Lackner and is still in development. Several commercial plants are planned or in operation in Europe and the US. Large-scale DAC deployment may be accelerated when connected with economical applications or policy incentives.
In contrast to carbon capture and storage (CCS) which captures emissions from a point source such as a factory, DAC reduces the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere as a whole. Typically, CCS is recommended for large and stationary sources of CO rather than distributed and movable ones. On the contrary, DAC has no limitation on sources. When combined with long-term storage of CO, DAC is known as direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS or DACS). DACCS can act as a carbon dioxide removal mechanism, although as of  it has yet to be profitable because the cost per tonne of carbon dioxide is several times the carbon price.Downsizer is a virtual community, run on a not-for-profit basis, which describes itself as ""a resource for people who want to live more sustainably"". Its website includes articles on sustainable living and a popular forum with over , registered members.A drawbridge mentality is the attitude of people who have migrated to a more exclusive or more ""unspoilt"" community and then campaign to preserve the tranquility of that community by opposing further inward migration by people or businesses and, possibly, any development or refurbishment, including plans put forward by those already located there.
The term can imply a selfish attitude and can be taken as an insult by people who have strong affection for their home locality and wish to protect it from any changes. It is closely related to the NIMBY attitude.""Raising the drawbridge"" can also be used to apply to TERFs and conservative female politicians.

A drawbridge was historically the hinged bridge at a castle's gates providing entry across a defensive moat.  Raising the drawbridge to a vertical position was therefore one's means by which intruders could be shut out of the castle.Ecoflation (a portmanteau of ""ecological"" and ""inflation"") is a future scenario in ""Rattling Supply Chains"", a research report by the World Resources Institute and A.T. Kearney, released in November . It is characterized by natural resources becoming scarcer and sustainability issues become more pressing, leading to an increase in the price of commodities. The effects of the increase in the price of commodities are felt by corporations suffering environmental costs being added to their usual cost of doing business. The concept of ecoflation focuses on having environmental externalities of business be the burden of the organization/business responsible, rather than costs being allocated to the general public. Ecoflation represents more accurate pricing of the true costs associated with business actions. The concepts also emphasized the necessity of businesses to be creative and innovative in order to adapt their business models and supply chains to remain competitive on the market. The idea is that the more a business integrates sustainability in their core business principle, the more success they will have.Ecological debt refers to the supposed accumulation of debt of the Global North to Global South countries, due to the net sum of historical environmental injustice, especially through resource exploitation, habitat degradation, and pollution by waste discharge. The concept was coined by Global Southerner non-governmental organizations in the s and its definition has varied over the years, in several attempts of greater specification.Within the ecological debt broad definition, there are two main aspects: the ecological damage caused over time by a country in one or other countries or to ecosystems beyond national jurisdiction through its production and consumption patterns; and the exploitation or use of ecosystems over time by a country at the expense of the equitable rights to these ecosystems by other countries.Ecological literacy (also referred to as ecoliteracy) is the ability to understand the natural systems that make life on earth possible. To be ecoliterate means understanding the principles of organization of ecological communities (i.e. ecosystems) and using those principles for creating sustainable human communities. The term was coined by American educator David W. Orr and physicist Fritjof Capra in the s – thereby a new value entered education; the ""well-being of the earth"".An ecologically literate society would be a sustainable society which did not destroy the natural environment on which they depend. Ecological literacy is a powerful concept as it creates a foundation for an integrated approach to environmental problems. Advocates champion eco-literacy as a new educational paradigm emerging around the poles of holism, systems thinking, sustainability, and complexity.Ecological overshoot is the phenomenon which occurs when the demands made on a natural ecosystem exceed its regenerative capacity. Global ecological overshoot occurs when the demands made by humanity exceed what the biosphere of Earth can provide through its capacity for renewal.Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) encompasses a broad set of approaches to adapt to climate change. They all involve the management of ecosystems and their services to reduce the vulnerability of human communities to the impacts of climate change. The Convention on Biological Diversity defines EbA as ""the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall adaptation strategy to help people to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change"".EbA involves the conservation, sustainable management and restoration of ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, wetlands, mangroves or coral reefs to reduce the harmful impacts of climate hazards including shifting patterns or levels of rainfall, changes in maximum and minimum temperatures, stronger storms, and increasingly variable climatic conditions. EbA measures can be implemented on their own or in combination with engineered approaches (such as the construction of water reservoirs or dykes), hybrid measures (such as artificial reefs) and approaches that strengthen the capacities of individuals and institutions to address climate risks (such as the introduction of early warning systems).
EbA is nested within the broader concept of nature-based solutions and complements and shares common elements with a wide variety of other approaches to building the resilience of social-ecological systems. These approaches include community-based adaptation, ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction, climate-smart agriculture, and green infrastructure, and often place emphasis on using participatory and inclusive processes and community/stakeholder engagement. The concept of EbA has been promoted through international fora, including the processes of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). A number of countries make explicit references to EbA in their strategies for adaptation to climate change and their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.While the barriers to widespread uptake of EbA by public and private sector stakeholders and decision makers are substantial, cooperation toward generating a greater understanding of the potential of EbA is well established among researchers, advocates, and practitioners from nature conservation and sustainable development groups. EbA is increasingly viewed as an effective means of addressing the linked challenges of climate change and poverty in developing countries, where many people are dependent on natural resources for their lives and livelihoods.Ecotivity is an abbreviation, or blend, of the term, ecological activity.  An ecotivity is any activity that promotes the conservation or sustainability of ecosystems and bio-diversity.
In more general terms, an ecotivity can be thought of as any ecologically friendly activity.  Ecotivities, therefore, make a positive contribution to averting the environmental crisis of the planet or means of effecting positive change.
Ecotivities include all associated values, actions, and choices either as a green consumer, or as an individual living a sustainable lifestyle, for example, by recycling or energy efficiency.  Ecotivity can also be of political, direct action, hands-on environmental conservation, and creative confrontational acts, that are a means to protect the environment.Ethical consumerism (alternatively called ethical consumption, ethical purchasing, moral purchasing, ethical sourcing, or ethical shopping and also associated with sustainable and green consumerism) is a type of consumer activism based on the concept of dollar voting. People practice it by buying ethically made products that support small-scale manufacturers or local artisans and protect animals and the environment, while boycotting products that exploit children as workers, are tested on animals, or damage the environment.The term ""ethical consumer"", now used generically, was first popularised by the UK magazine Ethical Consumer, first published in . Ethical Consumer magazine's key innovation was to produce ""ratings tables"", inspired by the criteria-based approach of the then-emerging ethical investment movement. Ethical Consumer's ratings tables awarded companies negative marks (and overall scores, starting in ) across a range of ethical and environmental categories such as ""animal rights"", ""human rights"", and ""pollution and toxics"", empowering consumers to make ethically informed consumption choices and providing campaigners with reliable information on corporate behaviour. Such criteria-based ethical and environmental ratings have subsequently become commonplace both in providing consumer information and in business-to-business corporate social responsibility and sustainability ratings such as those provided by Innovest, Calvert Foundation, Domini, IRRC, TIAA–CREF, and KLD Analytics. Today, Bloomberg and Reuters provide ""environmental, social, and governance"" ratings directly to the financial data screens of hundreds of thousands of stock market traders. The nonprofit Ethical Consumer Research Association continues to publish Ethical Consumer and its associated website, which provides free access to ethical rating tables.
Although single-source ethical consumerism guides such as Ethical Consumer, Shop Ethical, and the Good Shopping Guide are popular, they suffer from incomplete coverage. User-generated ethical reviews are more likely, long-term, to provide democratic, in-depth coverage of a wider range of products and businesses. The Green Stars Project promotes the idea of including ethical ratings (on a scale of one to five green stars) alongside conventional ratings on retail sites such as Amazon or review sites such as Yelp.
The term ""political consumerism,"" first used in a study titled ""The Gender Gap Reversed: Political Consumerism as a Women-Friendly Form of Civic and Political Engagement"" from authors Dietlind Stolle and Michele Micheletti, is identical to the idea of ethical consumerism. However, in this study, the authors found that political consumerism was a form of social participation that often went overlooked at the time of writing and needs to be accounted for in future studies of social participation.Factor Ten is a social and economic policy program developed by the Factor Ten institute with the stated goal of ""provid[ing] practical support for achieving significant advances in sustainable value creation, in particular through increases in resource productivity throughout the economy.The Food Justice Movement is a grassroots initiative which emerged in response to food insecurity and economic pressures that prevent access to healthy, nutritious, and culturally appropriate foods (food should fit the cultural background of the people consuming it). It includes more broad policy movements, such as the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations.Food justice recognizes the food system as ""a racial project and problematizes the influence of race and class on the production, distribution and consumption of food"". This encompasses farm labor work, land disputes, issues of status and class, environmental justice, public politics, and advocacy. Food justice is closely connected to food sovereignty, which critiques ""structural barriers communities of color face to accessing local and organic foods"" that are largely due to institutional racism and the effect it has on economic equality. It is argued that lack of access to good food is both a cause and a symptom of the structural inequalities that divide society. A possible solution presented for poor areas includes community gardens, fairness for food workers, and a national food policy.Foodscaping is a modern term for the practice of integrating edible plants into ornamental landscapes. It is also referred to as edible landscaping and has been described as a crossbreed between landscaping and farming. As an ideology, foodscaping aims to show that edible plants are not only consumable but can also be appreciated for their aesthetic qualities. Foodscaping spaces are seen as multi-functional landscapes which are visually attractive and also provide edible returns. Foodscaping is a great way to provide fresh food in an affordable way. 
Differing from conventional vegetable gardening, where fruits and vegetables are typically grown in separate, enclosed areas, foodscaping incorporates edible plants as a major element of a pre-existing landscaping space. This may involve adding edible plantations to an existing ornamental garden or entirely replacing the traditional, non-edible plants with food-yielding species. The designs can incorporate various kinds of vegetables, fruit trees, berry bushes, edible flowers, and herbs, along with purely ornamental species. The design strategy of foodscaping has many benefits, including increasing food security, improving the growth of nutritious food and promoting sustainable living. Edible landscaping practices may be implemented on both public and private premises. Foodscaping can be practiced by individuals, community groups, businesses, or educational institutions.
The practice of foodscaping is believed to have gained popularity in the st century for several reasons. Some accounts claim that the rise of foodscaping is due to the volatility of global food prices and the financial crisis of –. However, other accounts suggest that the spike in foodscaping popularity is linked to urbanization and increasing concerns for environmental sustainability.Global Green is the American affiliate of Green Cross International, an international non-governmental organization founded by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in  to ""foster a global value shift toward a sustainable and secure future.""  Green Cross International operates in over  countries and enjoys consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Global Green USA is on a  year mission to ""lead a global response to keep us within planetary boundaries"" and to ""bring forth a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace"". GCI is an admitted observer organization with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. It also cooperates directly with the UNEP/OCHA Environmental Emergencies Section, UN-HABITAT and other international organizations. Celebrity advocates include Leonardo DiCaprio, Yoko Ono and Pat Mitchell, who serves as an Honorary Board Member.The Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) [Originally QSAS] is the first performance-based system in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, developed for assessing and rating buildings and infrastructure for their sustainability impacts. In , FIFA officially endorsed GSAS as the sustainability assessment system for Qatar's eight stadiums set to host the  FIFA World Cup. The primary objective of GSAS is to create a sustainable built environment that minimizes ecological impact and reduces resources consumption while addressing the local needs and environmental conditions specific to the region. GSAS adopts an integrated lifecycle approach for the assessment of the built environment including design, construction and operation phases.
Developed in  by the Gulf Organisation for Research and Development (GORD) in collaboration with the TC Chan Center at the University of Pennsylvania, the School of Architecture at the Georgia Tech Research Institute, and other reputed houses of expertise, GSAS announced its fourth edition in . GSAS manuals are revised on a regular basis to reflect all technical changes and provide relevant information to stay conversant based on best practices, GSAS Trust experience and GSAS users feedback. With GSAS at its core, GORD has built a comprehensive continuum of sustainability that encompasses everything from assessing and rating built-environments to educating and certifying professionals.
GSAS framework is comprehensive and designed to follow an integrated life cycle approach to improve the sustainability performance of the built environment. GSAS addresses the sustainability impacts during the design, construction and operation stages of buildings and infrastructure projects. The framework addresses eight categories of macro and micro level aspects for a multidimensional focus on sustainability. These categories are Urban Connectivity; Site; Energy; Water; Materials; Indoor/Outdoor Environment; Cultural & Economic Value; and Management & Operations. Each GSAS Category is associated with a direct impact on environmental sustainability and/or human well-being and provides indicators to measure different associated aspects. These categories are then sub-divided into specific criteria that measure and define the individual issues. Categories, criteria, and measurements are defined to be performance based and quantifiable, as far as possible.
GSAS identifies several sustainability challenges in the built environment. The challenges include air pollution, land use contamination, fossil fuel depletion, water depletion, water pollution, materials depletion, human discomfort and sickness and climate change. These challenges were used to guide the identified framework to ensure robustness in mitigating the adverse environmental impacts of the built environment.Government by algorithm (also known as algorithmic regulation, regulation by algorithms, algorithmic governance, algocratic governance, algorithmic legal order or algocracy) is an alternative form of government or social ordering, where the usage of computer algorithms, especially of artificial intelligence and blockchain, is applied to regulations, law enforcement, and generally any aspect of everyday life such as transportation or land registration. The term 'government by algorithm' appeared in academic literature as an alternative for 'algorithmic governance' in . A related term, algorithmic regulation is defined as setting the standard, monitoring and modifying behaviour by means of computational algorithms — automation of judiciary is in its scope. In the context of blockchain, it is also known as blockchain governance.Government by algorithm raises new challenges that are not captured in the e-government literature and the practice of public administration. Some sources equate cyberocracy, which is a hypothetical form of government that rules by the effective use of information, with algorithmic governance, although algorithms are not the only means of processing information. Nello Cristianini and Teresa Scantamburlo argued that the combination of a human society and certain regulation algorithms (such as reputation-based scoring) forms a social machine.Green building (also known as green construction or sustainable building) refers to both a structure and the application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle: from planning to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. This requires close cooperation of the contractor, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages. The Green Building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort. Green building also refers to saving resources to the maximum extent, including energy saving, land saving, water saving, material saving, etc., during the whole life cycle of the building, protecting the environment and reducing pollution, providing people with healthy, comfortable and efficient use of space, and being in harmony with nature Buildings that live in harmony. Green building technology focuses on low consumption, high efficiency, economy, environmental protection, integration and optimization.’Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings which was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council. Other certificate systems that confirm the sustainability of buildings are the British BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) for buildings and large-scale developments or the DGNB System (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Nachhaltiges Bauen e.V.) which benchmarks the sustainability performance of buildings, indoor environments and districts. Currently, the World Green Building Council is conducting research on the effects of green buildings on the health and productivity of their users and is working with the World Bank to promote Green Buildings in Emerging Markets through EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) Market Transformation Program and certification. There are also other tools such as Green Star in Australia, Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) used in the Middle East and the Green Building Index (GBI) predominantly used in Malaysia.
Building information modeling (BIM) is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places. Building information models (BIMs) are files (often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data) which can be extracted, exchanged, or networked to support decision-making regarding a building or other built asset. Current BIM software is used by individuals, businesses, and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain diverse physical infrastructures, such as water, refuse, electricity, gas, communication utilities, roads, railways, bridges, ports, and tunnels.
Although new technologies are constantly being developed to complement current practices in creating greener structures, the common objective of green buildings is to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by:

Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources
Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity (see healthy building)
Reducing waste, pollution, and environmental degradationNatural building is a similar concept, usually on a smaller scale and focusing on the use of locally available natural materials. Other related topics include sustainable design and green architecture. Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Although some green building programs don't address the issue of retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment. Green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction.
A  report by the U.S. General Services Administration found  sustainably-designed buildings that cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance. In addition, occupants were overall more satisfied with the building than those in typical commercial buildings. These are eco-friendly buildings.A green guide (or sustainability guide) is a set of rules and guidelines provided for the use of a general or selective population to achieve the goal of becoming more green or sustainable. The guide serves to direct individuals, agencies, companies, businesses, etc. to resources that can help them become more sustainable (or ‘green’), as sustainability becomes a more popular and growing lifestyle choice. Guides are available in many ways, but the most popular being through websites to avoid using paper. There has also been a surge of guides in university websites to encourage students towards a more sustainable way of life.Green human resource management (Green HRM or GHRM) emerged as an academic concept from the debate of sustainable development and corporate sustainability. Wehrmeyer () is often stated as laying the foundation with his idea that ""if a company is to adopt an environmentally-aware approach to its activities, the employees are the key to its success or failure"".One of the most common definitions refers to GHRM as ""the HRM aspects of Environmental Management"". A broader definition considers GHRM as ""phenomena relevant to understanding relationships between organizational activities that impact the natural environment and the design, evolution, implementation and influence of HRM systems.""Some goals of GHRM include alerting employees to global environmental issues through initiating proposal schemes, training employees on greener practices, and encouraging employees to join and find sustainable initiatives.In May , the German Journal of Human Resource Management published a special issue on GHRM, which comprises five contributions.A green museum is a museum that incorporates concepts of sustainability into its operations, programming, and facility. Many green museums use their collections to produce exhibitions, events, classes, and other programming to educate the public about the natural environment. Many, but not all, green museums reside in a building featuring sustainable architecture and technology. Green museums interpret their own sustainable practices and green design to present a model of behavior.
Green museums strive to help people become more conscious of the limitations of their world, and how their actions affect their world. The goal is to create positive change by encouraging people to make sustainable choices in their daily lives. They use their position as community-centered institutions to create a culture of sustainability.A Green Office (in some cases also called Student Green Office, (Student) Green Unit, Sustainability Hub, or Nachhaltigkeitsbüro (German)) is a sustainability department or office that enables students and other actors such as academics and staff to act on sustainability at their university.  The model differs from other approaches of sustainability governance, as it allows students to actively contribute to their university’s sustainability efforts. Through its institutional mandate, funding and support, a Green Office addresses common barriers which prevent sustainability student groups from having more of an impact on their university.The first Green Office was established at Maastricht University in  as the institution’s student-run sustainability department. The model has since spread to over  higher education institutions in various countries, mainly in Europe. It is particularly popular in the Netherlands, where most of the universities have established a Green Office. The model is actively being spread by the social business Green Office Movement (previously known as rootAbility) and is freely available under a Creative Commons License.A green wedding or an eco-friendly wedding is any wedding where the couple plans to decrease the ecological impact of their special event on the planet. Couples plan their weddings by integrating eco-friendly alternatives, such as eco-friendly invitations, flowers, dress, photography, and more.Growth imperative is a term in economic theory regarding a possible necessity of economic growth. On the micro level, it describes mechanisms that force firms or consumers (households) to increase revenues or consumption to not endanger their income. On the macro level, a political growth imperative exists if economic growth is necessary to avoid economic and social instability or to retain democratic legitimacy, so that other political goals such as climate change mitigation or a reduction of inequality are subordinated to growth policies.Current neoclassical, Keynesian and endogenous growth theories do not consider a growth imperative or explicitly deny it, such as Robert Solow. In neoclassical economics, adherence to economic growth would be a question of maximizing utility, an intertemporal decision between current and future consumption (see Keynes–Ramsey rule). Other sociological and political theories consider several possible causes for pursuing economic growth, for example maximizing profit, social comparison, culture (conformity), or political ideologies, but they do not regard them to be compulsive. Possible growth imperatives are discussed in Marxist theory, Schumpeterian theory of creative destruction and ecological economics, as well as in political debates on post-growth and degrowth. It is disputed whether growth imperative is a meaningful concept altogether, who would be affected by it, and which mechanism would be responsible.HPro is an Israeli startup company that is developing cheaper hydrogen fuel produced by sustainable energy. The company was co-founded in  by Talmon Marco, Gideon Grader, Avner Rothschild, and Hen Dotan. HPro has received backing from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and from Hong Kong entrepreneur Li Ka-shing. In , Hyundai invested in HPro.An inclusive business model is a type of business model that seeks to create value for low-income communities by integrating them into a company's value chain on the demand side as clients and consumers, and/or on the supply side as producers, entrepreneurs or employees in a sustainable way.The businesses that design and use these business models can range from multinational corporations to large domestic companies, co-operatives, small and medium-sized enterprises, or even not-for-profit organizations that use business principles—or social business approaches—to achieve their mission.Since social value creation is integral to how inclusive business models intend to capture value, they differ from corporate philanthropy or corporate social responsibility. Businesses adopting inclusive business models can become inclusive businesses when they succeed in creating intended value and avoiding value destruction.The UK Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium (ITRC) was established in January . The ITRC provides data and modelling to help governments, policymakers and other stakeholders in infrastructure make more sustainable and resilient infrastructure decisions. It is a collaboration between seven universities and more than  partners from infrastructure policy and practice.During its first research programme, running from  to , ITRC developed the world's first national infrastructure system-of-systems model, known as NISMOD (National Infrastructure Systems Model) which has been used to analyse long-term investment strategies for energy, transport, digital communications, water, waste water and solid waste. This work is described in the book 'The Future of National Infrastructure', an introduction to the NISMOD models and tools describing their application to inform infrastructure planning in Britain.
The second phase of this programme (-) is called ITRC-MISTRAL where MISTRAL stands for Multi-Scale Infrastructure Systems Analytics. MISTRAL allowed ITRC to develop the national-scale modelling in ITRC to simulate infrastructure at city, regional and global scales.
Based in the University of Oxford 's Environmental Change Institute, ITRC is led by Director Jim Hall who is also Professor of Environmental Risks at the University of Oxford.Funding: The ITRC is funded by two programme grants from the UK Engineering and Physical Science and Research Council (EPSRC). The - ITRC programme grant was £.m and the - grant, for ITRC-MISTRAL, is £.m.Consortium: The seven universities making up the ITRC consortium are: University of Southampton, University of Oxford, Newcastle University, Cardiff University, University of Cambridge, University of Leeds and University of Sussex.
Partners: ITRC's partners are from across the infrastructure sector. They include infrastructure investors such as the World Bank, consultancies including Ordnance Survey and KPMG, providers such as Siemens, High Speed  (HS), Network Rail and National Grid, policy-makers (i.e. Environment Agency) and regulatory bodies (OFCOM).


== References ==ISO  (full name: ISO :, Event sustainability management systems –- Requirements with guidance for use) is a voluntary international standard for sustainable event management, created by the International Organization for Standardization. The standard aims to help organizations improve sustainability throughout the entire event management cycle.The Karlskrona Manifesto for sustainability design in software was created as an output of the Third International Workshop on Requirements Engineering for Sustainable Systems (RESuSy) held in Karlskrona, Sweden, co-located with the nd IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE'). The manifesto arose from a suggestion in the paper by Christoph Becker, ""Sustainability and Longevity: Two Sides of the Same Quality?"" that sustainability is a common ground for several disciplines related to software, but that this commonality had not been mapped out and made explicit and that a focal point of reference would be beneficial.Fred Kirschenmann (born February , ) is an American professor, organic farmer, and a leader in the sustainable agriculture movement. He is board president of Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture and the former director of the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture. He is considered ""one of the most prominent spokesmen for the sustainable farming movement.""The Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture (LCSA) is a center at Iowa State University devoted to the study and promotion of new techniques in sustainable agriculture. The goals of the Center are: “to identify and develop new ways to farm profitably while conserving natural resources as well as reducing negative environmental and social impacts.”
It is considered “one of the top institutions supporting research on agricultural techniques that prioritize sustainability and conservation in the context of profitable farming.”The following is a list of environmental podcasts that focus on environmentalism, sustainability, climate change, and pollution.Microfinance is a category of financial services targeting individuals and small businesses who lack access to conventional banking and related services. Microfinance includes microcredit, the provision of small loans to poor clients; savings and checking accounts; microinsurance; and payment systems, among other services. Microfinance services are designed to reach excluded customers, usually poorer population segments, possibly socially marginalized, or geographically more isolated, and to help them become self-sufficient. ID Ghana is an example of a microfinance institution. 
Microfinance initially had a limited definition: the provision of microloans to poor entrepreneurs and small businesses lacking access to credit. The two main mechanisms for the delivery of financial services to such clients were: () relationship-based banking for individual entrepreneurs and small businesses; and () group-based models, where several entrepreneurs come together to apply for loans and other services as a group. Over time, microfinance has emerged as a larger movement whose object is: ""a world in which as everyone, especially the poor and socially marginalized people and households have access to a wide range of affordable, high quality financial products and services, including not just credit but also savings, insurance, payment services, and fund transfers.""Proponents of microfinance often claim that such access will help poor people out of poverty, including participants in the Microcredit Summit Campaign. For many, microfinance is a way to promote economic development, employment and growth through the support of micro-entrepreneurs and small businesses; for others it is a way for the poor to manage their finances more effectively and take advantage of economic opportunities while managing the risks. Critics often point to some of the ills of micro-credit that can create indebtedness. Many studies have tried to assess its impacts.New research in the area of microfinance call for better understanding of the microfinance ecosystem so that the microfinance institutions and other facilitators can formulate sustainable strategies that will help create social benefits through better service delivery to the low-income population.Mobility transition is a set of social, technological and political processes of converting traffic (including freight transport) and mobility to sustainable transport with renewable energy resources, and an integration of several different modes of private transport and local public transport. It also includes social change, a redistribution of public spaces, and different ways of financing and spending money in urban planning. The main motivation for mobility transition is the reduction of the harm and damage that traffic causes to people (mostly but not solely due to collisions) and the environment (which also often directly or indirectly affects people) in order to make (urban) society more livable, as well as solving various interconnected logistical, social, economic and energy issues and inefficiencies.The Music of the Spheres World Tour is the ongoing eighth concert tour currently being undertaken by British rock band Coldplay. It was announced on  October  in support of their ninth studio album Music of the Spheres and marked a return to live performing after the COVID- pandemic. The band had not toured for their previous record, Everyday Life (), putting shows on hold until they could work out how to ensure it would be environmentally friendly. According to a plan they developed for over two years, emissions are meant to be reduced by % compared to A Head Full of Dreams Tour (–). 
Similar to the Mylo Xyloto Tour (–),  the concert run features extensive use of pyrotechnic and confetti visuals. However, they were adapted to reduce emissions: the former has less explosive charge and uses new formulas to reduce harmful chemicals, while the latter is % biodegradable and require less compressed gas for ignition. Meanwhile, Xylobands were replaced by PixMob wristbands made from plant-based materials. Other efforts include the first ever mobile rechargeable show battery (developed with BMW) and a mobile application to interact with fans and help them to take environmentally conscious travel options.
Coldplay also partnered with One Tree Planted, ClientEarth, the Grantham Institute and numerous other organizations to ensure their endeavour's success. Additionally, the band pledged to plant a tree for every ticket sold through a reforestation agreement. They broke many records in Latin America and Europe as sales began, moving over one million tickets in both continents. The tour started in Costa Rica's Estadio Nacional on  March  and was met with widespread acclaim from music critics, who praised their stage presence and joyful performance, concluding the shows were ""triumphant"", ""immersive"" and ""intimate"".Nemo's Garden is an underwater cultivation designed by Sergio Gamberini along with a team from Ocean Reef Group in , and currently coordinated by Gianni Fontanesi. The project was born to face main global issues, such as: climate change, pollution, malnourishment and hunger. It actively operates, and is open to visitors, from late June until late September.
The garden is located in Noli, Italy, and it consists in an underwater installation of several vinyl-plastic biospheres containing various kinds of herbs, vegetables and flowers that are being tested and observed for this alternative and sustainable way of gardening.This concept of underwater agriculture exploits the sea, and the possibilities it offers, as its primary resource. It aims to be adaptable to the most hostile places on earth, where the lack of agricultural means causes poverty and hunger, and repopulate the reef in areas where pollution has destroyed it.Nemo's Garden has the main goal of not harming the planet, consequently it was designed to be: self-sustainable, using mainly renewable energy from natural resources such as the sun and having the ability of reutilizing the freshwater it produces, eco-friendly, not harming the surrounding environment and its natural marine ecosystem that is heterogeneous, has an oligotrophic nature, a high diversity in marine species, and a high rate of endemism, and ecological, not producing any pollution.The project is divided into two phases: the one going from  until , called ""the  phase"", and the one being observed now. During the  phase the objectives were: collecting data from the plants and analyzing their characteristics, designing and making the hydroponic system work, and taking into consideration the possibility of using the garden in cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical applications.North Campus Open Space (NCOS) is a -acre wetland and upland restoration project located on a former golf course in Goleta, California. NCOS is managed by the Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER), a research center under the Office of Research at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). The primary objectives of this project are: the restoration of the historic upper half of Devereux Slough and adjacent upland and wetland habitats that support important local native plant and animal species (including rare and threatened species), reducing flood risk, providing a buffer against predicted sea level rise, and contributing to carbon sequestration while also supporting public access and outreach, and facilitating research and educational opportunities for all members of the community.North-South research partnerships consist of collaborations between researchers from countries in the Global North and the Global South. By establishing equal partnerships in North-South research, economic, social and cultural boundaries can be overcome. Such partnerships can address and enable research of issues in dynamic and complex contexts, as well as deal with uncertainties. Moreover, such research cooperation allows different perspectives to be taken into account to explore issues that are strongly value driven or linked to conflicting interests and power claims. Thus, North-South research partnerships provide new insights in the transition towards sustainable development and facilitate the development of solutions to local and global challenges.Operation Sustainable Human is a  book by Chris Macdonald about optimised climate action. The book briefly outlines the main challenges of climate change and largely focuses on the most impactful climate solutions.Planetary boundaries is a concept highlighting human-caused perturbations of Earth systems making them relevant in a way not accommodated by the environmental boundaries separating the three ages within the Holocene epoch. Crossing a planetary boundary comes at the risk of abrupt environmental change. The framework is based on scientific evidence that human actions, especially those of industrialized societies since the Industrial Revolution, have become the main driver of global environmental change. According to the framework, ""transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental-scale to planetary-scale systems.""The normative component of the framework is that human societies have been able to thrive under the comparatively stable climatic and ecological conditions of the Holocene. To the extent that these Earth system process boundaries have not been crossed, they mark the “safe zone” for human societies on the planet. The concept has since become influential in the international community (e.g. United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development), including governments at all levels, international organizations, civil society and the scientific community. The framework consists of nine global change processes. In , according to Rockström and others, two boundaries were already crossed, while others were in imminent danger of being crossed.In , several of the scientists in the original group published an update, bringing in new co-authors and new model-based analysis. According to this update, four of the boundaries were crossed: climate change, loss of biosphere integrity, land-system change, altered biogeochemical cycles (phosphorus and nitrogen). The scientists also changed the name of the boundary ""Loss of biodiversity"" to ""Change in biosphere integrity"" to emphasize that not only the number of species but also the functioning of the biosphere as a whole is important for Earth system stability. Similarly, the ""Chemical pollution"" boundary was renamed to ""Introduction of novel entities,"" widening the scope to consider different kinds of human-generated materials that disrupt Earth system processes.

In , based on available literature, the introduction of novel entities was concluded to be the th transgressed planetary boundary.Practical Farmers of Iowa (also known as PFI or Practical Farmers) is a non-profit farmer organization supporting agricultural producers in Iowa, and around the central United States. 
PFI's mission is to advance profitable, ecologically sound, and community-enhancing approaches to agriculture through farmer-led investigation and information sharing.
Practical Farmers of Iowa is a (c)() nonprofit charitable organization. For fiscal year , Practical Farmers had an operating budget of approximately $. million.The idea of public ecology has recently emerged in response to increasing disparities over political, social, and environmental concerns.  Of particular interest are the processes that generate, evaluate and apply knowledge in political, social, and environmental arenas.  Public ecology offers a way of framing sustainability problems, community dynamics and social issues.  Forests, watersheds, parks, flora, fauna, air, and water all constitute environmental quality and are therefore public goods.  The processes society engages in to negotiate the meaning of these goods, upon which decisions and actions are based, reside within the public domain.Radical sustainability recognizes that a system is not sustainable if any part of it is unsustainable. An economy cannot be sustained if the underlying social structure is unsustainable. A social structure cannot be sustained if the environment it depends upon is unsustainable. Vice versa, we find that in our modern day the environment cannot be sustained unless proper economical and social practices are in place.

A radical sustainability viewpoint recognizes the inseparability of ecological and social issues and the necessity of ensuring the solution to one problem does not create or worsen another.
The radical sustainable philosophy addressed problems of sustainability through a bottom-up approach - a form of ""grass roots"" sustainability.
Radical sustainability advocates and supports autonomous development, indigenous movements, women's rights,  social justice and green practices.
There are those who note that radical sustainability is accepted as a general vision, indicating a complex process once it is translated to specific goals. In terms of transitioning towards sustainable urban systems, a criticism also cites the inconsistency of its approaches with the established architecture making it less favorable.Richard C. Reames (born September , ) is an American artist, arborsculptor, nurseryman, writer, and public speaker. He lives and works in Williams, Oregon. He sometimes teaches at the John C. Campbell Folk School.Reames coined the word ""arborsculpture"" to describe the art of shaping living tree trunks and woody plants into sculptural forms, furniture and shelters.:   His writing and artistic practice are grounded in ecological principles of living in harmony with nature and with creating living structures from trees. He has written two books on arborsculpture and tree shaping.
Reames' work has been exhibited at the World Expo  in Aichi, Japan.Sancroft International is a London-based international sustainability consultancy company founded in   and chaired by former UK conservative MP John Gummer, now a member of the House of Lords (Lord Deben). Several other members of the Gummer family are involved in running the business.Recently-published reports have investigated topics including sustainable plastics, energy infrastructure, and modern slavery in public procurement.


== References ==Seven generation stewardship is a concept that urges the current generation of humans to live and work for the benefit of the seventh generation into the future.
It is believed to have originated with the Iroquois – Great Law of the Iroquois – which holds appropriate to think seven generations ahead and decide whether the decisions they make today would benefit their descendants.  It is frequently associated with the modern, popular concept of environmental stewardship or 'sustainability' but it is much broader in context.Simple living refers to practices that promote simplicity in one's lifestyle. Common practices of simple living include reducing the number of possessions one owns, depending less on technology and services, and spending less money. Not only is simple living focused on external changes such as minimalism through fewer commitments or possessions but it also connects to the human's mindset and set of beliefs. These practices can be seen throughout history, religion, art, and economics.
Adherents may choose simple living for a variety of personal reasons, such as spirituality, health, increase in quality time for family and friends, work–life balance, personal taste, financial sustainability, increase in philanthropy, frugality, environmental sustainability, or reducing stress. Simple living can also be a reaction to materialism and conspicuous consumption. Some cite sociopolitical goals aligned with environmentalist, anti-consumerist or anti-war movements, including conservation, degrowth, deep ecology, and tax resistance.A social enterprise is an organization that applies commercial strategies to maximize improvements in financial, social and environmental well-being. This may include maximizing social impact alongside profits for co-owners.
Social enterprises can be structured as a business, a partnership for-profit or non-profit, and may take the form (depending on in which country the entity exists and the legal forms available) of a co-operative, mutual organization, a disregarded entity, a social business, a benefit corporation, a community interest company, a company limited by guarantee or a charity organisation. They can also take more conventional structures.
Social enterprises have business, environmental and social goals. As a result, their social goals are embedded in their objective, which differentiates them from other organisations and companies. A social enterprise's main purpose is to promote, encourage, and make social change. Social enterprises are businesses created to further a social purpose in a financially sustainable way. Social enterprises can provide income generation opportunities that meet the basic needs of people who live in poverty. They are sustainable and earned income from sales is reinvested in their mission. They do not depend on philanthropy and can sustain themselves over the long term. Their models can be expanded or replicated to other communities to generate more impact.
A social enterprise can be more sustainable than a nonprofit organisation that may solely rely on grant money, donations or government policies alone.Social entrepreneurship is an approach by individuals, groups, start-up companies or entrepreneurs, in which they develop, fund and implement solutions to social, cultural, or environmental issues. This concept may be applied to a wide range of organizations, which vary in size, aims, and beliefs. For-profit entrepreneurs typically measure performance using business metrics like profit, revenues and increases in stock prices. Social entrepreneurs, however, are either non-profits, or they blend for-profit goals with generating a positive ""return to society"". Therefore, they use different metrics. Social entrepreneurship typically attempts to further broad social, cultural and environmental goals often associated with the voluntary sector in areas such as poverty alleviation, health care and community development.
At times, profit-making social enterprises may be established to support the social or cultural goals of the organization but not as an end in themselves. For example, an organization that aims to provide housing and employment to the homeless may operate a restaurant, both to raise money and to provide employment for the homeless.
In , social entrepreneurship was facilitated by the use of the Internet, particularly social networking and social media websites. These websites enable social entrepreneurs to reach numerous people who are not geographically close yet who share the same goals and encourage them to collaborate online, learn about the issues, disseminate information about the group's events and activities, and raise funds through crowdfunding.In recent years, researchers have been calling for a better understanding of the ecosystem in which social entrepreneurship exists and social ventures operate. This will help them formulate better strategy and help achieve their double bottom line objective.A Social Venture (also called a social enterprise) is undertaking by a firm or organization established by a social entrepreneur that seeks to provide systemic solutions to achieve a sustainable, social objective.Spaceship Earth (or Spacecraft Earth or Spaceship Planet Earth) is a worldview encouraging everyone on Earth to act as a harmonious crew working toward the greater good.Sterling College is a private college in Craftsbury, Vermont. Sterling is one of nine colleges in the Work College Consortium and its curriculum is focused on ecological thinking and action through majors in Ecology, Environmental Humanities, Outdoor Education, Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems. The college is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges and the Association for Experiential Education.Sustainability advertising is communications geared towards promoting social, economic and environmental benefits (sustainability) of products, services or actions through paid advertising in media in order to encourage responsible behavior of consumers.Precise definitions of sustainable construction vary from place to place, and are constantly evolving to encompass varying approaches and priorities. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines sustainable construction as ""the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation and deconstruction."" The Netherlands defines sustainable construction as ""a way of building which aims at reducing (negative) health and environmental impacts caused by the construction process or by buildings or by the built-up environment."" More comprehensively, sustainability can be considered from three dimension of planet, people and profit across the entire construction supply chain. Key concepts include the protection of the natural environment, choice of non-toxic materials, reduction and reuse of resources, waste minimization, and the use of life-cycle cost analysis.Sustainability science first emerged in the s and has become a new academic discipline
Similar to agricultural science or health science, it is an applied science defined by the practical problems it addresses.  Sustainability science focuses on issues relating to sustainability and sustainable development as core parts of its subject matter.  It is  ""defined by the problems it addresses rather than by the disciplines it employs"" and ""serves the need for advancing both knowledge and action by creating a dynamic bridge between the two"".The field is focused on examining the interactions between human, environmental, and engineered systems to understand and contribute to solutions for complex challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the integrity of the life support systems of the planet, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution and land and water degradation.Sustainability science draws upon the related but not identical concepts of sustainable development and environmental science. Sustainability science provides a critical framework for sustainability while sustainability measurement provides the evidence-based quantitative data needed to guide sustainability governance.Sustainability studies focuses on the interdisciplinary perspective of the concept of Sustainability. Programs include instruction in sustainable development, geography, environmental policies, ethics, ecology, landscape architecture, city and regional planning, economics, natural resources, sociology, and anthropology. Sustainability studies also focuses on the importance of climate change, poverty and development. Many universities across the United States currently offer sustainability studies. The main goal of sustainability studies is for students to find ways to develop creative solutions to the problems in environmental sustainability.Sustainable architecture is architecture that seeks to minimize the negative environmental impact of buildings through improved efficiency and moderation in the use of materials, energy, development space and the ecosystem at large. Sustainable architecture uses a conscious approach to energy and ecological conservation in the design of the built environment.The idea of sustainability, or ecological design, is to ensure that our use of presently available resources does not end up having detrimental effects to our collective well-being or making it impossible to obtain resources for other applications in the long run.A sustainable business, or a green business, is an enterprise that has minimal negative impact or potentially a positive effect on the global or local environment, community, society, or economy—a business that strives to meet the triple bottom line. They cluster under different groupings and the whole is sometimes referred to as ""green capitalism."" Often, sustainable businesses have progressive environmental and human rights policies. In general, business is described as green if it matches the following four criteria:
It incorporates principles of sustainability into each of its business decisions.
It supplies environmentally friendly products or services that replaces demand for nongreen products and/or services.
It is greener than traditional competition.
It has made an enduring commitment to environmental principles in its business operations.The sustainable city, eco-city, or green city is a city designed with consideration for social, economic, environmental impact (commonly referred to as the triple bottom line), and resilient habitat for existing populations, without compromising the ability of future generations to experience the same. The UN Sustainable Development Goal  defines sustainable cities as those that are dedicated to achieving green sustainability, social sustainability and economic sustainability. They are committed to doing so by enabling opportunities for all through a design focused on inclusivity as well as maintaining a sustainable economic growth. The focus also includes minimizing required inputs of energy, water, and food, and drastically reducing waste, output of heat, air pollution – CO, methane, and water pollution. Richard Register first coined the term ecocity in his  book Ecocity Berkeley: Building Cities for a Healthy Future, where he offers innovative city planning solutions that would work anywhere. Other leading figures who envisioned  sustainable cities are architect Paul F Downton, who later founded the company Ecopolis Pty Ltd, as well as authors Timothy Beatley and Steffen Lehmann, who have written extensively on the subject. The field of industrial ecology is sometimes used in planning these cities.

The UN Environment Programme calls out that most cities today are struggling with environmental degradation, traffic congestion, inadequate urban infrastructure, in addition to a lack of basic services, such as water supply, sanitation, and waste management. A sustainable city should promote economic growth and meet the basic needs of its inhabitants, while creating sustainable living conditions for all. Ideally, a sustainable city is one that creates an enduring way of life across the four domains of ecology, economics, politics and culture. The European Investment Bank is assisting cities in the development of long-term strategies in fields including renewable transportation, energy efficiency, sustainable housing, education, and health care. The European Investment Bank has spent more than € billion in bettering cities over the last eight years.Cities occupy just  percent of the Earth's land but account for  to  percent of energy consumption and at least  percent of carbon emissions. Thus, creating safe, resilient and sustainable cities is one of the top priorities of the Sustainable Development Goals. The Adelaide City Council states that socially sustainable cities should be equitable, diverse, connected, democratic, and provide a good quality of life. Priorities of a sustainable city include the ability to feed itself with a sustainable reliance on the surrounding natural environment and the ability to power itself with renewable sources of energy, while creating the smallest conceivable ecological footprint and the lowest quantity of pollution achievable. All of this is to be accomplished by efficient land use, composting organic matter, recycling used materials, and/or converting waste-to-energy. The idea is that these contributions will lead to a decrease of the city's impact on climate change.
Today,  percent of the world is estimated to be living in urban areas and the United Nations estimates that by the year , that number will rise to  percent. By , there may be nearly . more billion individuals living in urban cities, possibly making it more difficult to create more sustainable communities. These large communities provide both challenges and opportunities for environmentally-conscious developers. There are distinct advantages to further defining and working towards the goals of sustainable cities. Humans are social creatures and thrive in urban spaces that foster social connections. Richard Florida, an urban studies theorist, focuses on the social impact of sustainable cities and states that cities need more than a competitive business climate; they should promote a great people climate that appeals to individuals and families of all types. Because of this, a shift to denser urban living would provide an outlet for social interaction and conditions under which humans can prosper. These types of urban areas would also promote the use of public transit, walkability and biking which would benefit citizens' health as well as benefiting the environment.Sustainable dentistry is when a dental organization voluntarily embeds corporate social responsibility into its organizational culture through the creation of a sustainability policy that outlines its commitment to and strategy for internally and externally focusing all its activities on realizing a triple bottom line, i.e. economic prosperity, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship. Managing sustainability in dentistry, therefore, is the implementation, monitoring, and adjusting of what this sustainability policy entails within a dental organization. Dental practices can uphold sustainable dentistry by reducing their carbon footprint through various methods such as monitoring product procurement.


== References ==Sustainable development is an organizing principle for meeting human development goals while also sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services on which the economy and society depend. The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resources are used to continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development was defined in the  Brundtland Report as ""Development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"". As the concept of sustainable development developed, it has shifted its focus more towards the economic development, social development and environmental protection for future generations.
Sustainable development was first institutionalized with the Rio Process initiated at the  Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. In  the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ( to ) and explained how the goals are integrated and indivisible to achieve sustainable development at the global level. The  goals address the global challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice.

Sustainable development is interlinked with the normative concept of sustainability. UNESCO formulated a distinction between the two concepts as follows: ""Sustainability is often thought of as a long-term goal (i.e. a more sustainable world), while sustainable development refers to the many processes and pathways to achieve it."" The concept of sustainable development has been criticized in various ways. While some see it as paradoxical (or an oxymoron) and regard development as inherently unsustainable, others are disappointed in the lack of progress that has been achieved so far. Part of the problem is that ""development"" itself is not consistently defined.: The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or Global Goals are a collection of  interlinked global goals designed to be a ""shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future"". The SDGs were set up in  by the United Nations General Assembly (UN-GA) and are intended to be achieved by . They are included in a UN-GA Resolution called the  Agenda or what is colloquially known as Agenda . The SDGs were developed in the Post- Development Agenda as the future global development framework to succeed the Millennium Development Goals which were ended in . The SDGs emphasize the interconnected environmental, social and economic aspects of sustainable development, by putting sustainability at their center.The  SDGs are: No poverty, zero hunger, good health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure,  Reduced Inequality, Sustainable Cities and Communities, Responsible Consumption and Production, Climate Action, Life Below Water, Life On Land, Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions, Partnerships for the Goals. Though the goals are broad and interdependent, two years later ( July ), the SDGs were made more ""actionable"" by a UN Resolution adopted by the General Assembly. The resolution identifies specific targets for each goal, along with indicators that are being used to measure progress toward each target. The year by which the target is meant to be achieved is usually between  and . For some of the targets, no end date is given.
There are cross-cutting issues and synergies between the different goals. Cross-cutting issues include gender equality, education, culture and health. With regards to SDG  on climate action, the IPCC sees robust synergies, particularly for the SDGs  (health),  (clean energy),  (cities and communities),  (responsible consumption and production) and  (oceans).:   Synergies amongst the SDGs are ""the good antagonists of trade-offs"".:   Some of the known and much discussed conceptual problem areas of the SDGs include: The fact that there are competing and too many goals (resulting in problems of trade-offs), that they are weak on environmental sustainability and that there are difficulties with tracking qualitative indicators. For example, these are two difficult trade-offs to consider: ""How can ending hunger be reconciled with environmental sustainability? (SDG targets . and .) How can economic growth be reconciled with environmental sustainability? (SDG targets . and .) ""The UN High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) is the annual space for global monitoring of the SDGs, under the auspices of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. However, it has so far failed to act as an orchestrator to promote system-wide coherence due to a lack of political leadership owing to divergent national interests.:   To facilitate monitoring of progress on the SDG implementation, a variety of tools exist to track and visualize this progress towards the goals. All intention is to make data more available and easily understood. For example, the ""SDG Tracker"", launched in June , presents available data across all indicators. There were serious impacts and implications of the COVID- pandemic on all  SDGs in the year . A scientific assessment released in  stated that the world is not on track to achieve the SDGs by  and concluded that the SDGs have so far had only limited political effects in global, national and local governance since their launch in .: Sustainable fashion (also known as eco-fashion) is a term describing products, processes, activities, and actors (policymakers, brands, consumers) aiming to achieve a carbon-neutral fashion industry, built on equality, social justice, animal welfare, and ecological integrity. Sustainable fashion concerns more than addressing fashion textiles or products. It addresses the entire process in which clothing is produced, consumed and disposed; who, what, how, when, where and the expected useful life of the product before entering landfill. The sustainable movement looks to combat the large carbon footprint that fast fashion has created by reducing the environmental impact of fashion such as air pollution, water pollution and overall climate change.
In , it was found that an approach of voluntary self-directed reform of textile manufacturing supply chains to reduce the environmental impact of fashion by large companies had failed. Measures to reform fashion beyond greenwashing needed to involve policies for the creation and enforcement of standardized certificates along with related import controls, subsidies and eco-tariff-like interventions.Sustainable film production is the concept of film production with particular concern for environmental, economic, and social issues. Sustainability in film production incorporates socially and environmentally responsible decision making into the pre-production and production of the film. It involves sustainable development principles at all levels of filmmaking and is best accomplished in a unified manner with collaboration and cooperation from all departments and/or participants in making the film. The sustainability of the film production should start at the launch of the project, and involve all of the key stakeholders including the director, film producer, production or costume designer, cast, and crew.
Film production can be sustainable by working with the triple bottom line of environmental, social, and economic factors. Environmentally, for example, by reducing carbon emissions produced by travel arrangements; selecting vehicles with less CO emissions, improved route planning, carpooling or adopting a more sustainable means of transport can help reduce the environmental footprint. Socially, by establishing clear guidelines for minimizing the impact of the filming schedule on local communities (one way this can be achieved by limiting hours of work and engaging early with communities about the logistical effects on the area) and by integrating social enterprising suppliers in the production's supply chain. Economically, the film production can be intentional about helping communities’ benefit from film activities: for example, by employing local residents and paying them appropriately or utilizing local props, extras and catering.
History
The discussion of sustainability in film began in the early s, as reported in The Hollywood Reporter and Variety. However, the attention was demonstrated in environmental content, environmental activism, and the philanthropy of celebrities rather than the production operations.
In Canada, British Columbia formalized their sustainable production efforts in  through the Reel Green initiative, a ""resource centre with a collection of best practices to help productions reduce their environmental impacts and improve their overall environmental footprint"". Following those initiatives in Canada, vendors such as Green Spark Group () and Keep it Green Recycling () have emerged to help productions with recycling and greenhouse gas accounting.
In the UK, the British Standard  was announced at the Cannes Film Festival in  to improve the British film industry's environmental, social, and economic impact after seeing how BS helped the British events sector.
Globally, many film studios have adopted sustainability initiatives, including the ""Big Five"": Universal Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures, Warner Bros., Columbia Pictures, and Paramount Pictures. As well as large television production studios like CBS.The global dedication to sustainable production by the industry has cultivated in the Sustainable Production Forum annually in Vancouver to gather for collaboration and dedication on sustainable film production. Topics discussed at the forum have included fleet transport in the film industry, compostable plastics and packaging, diversity in film, and the future of energy.
Awards for Sustainable Production
The Environmental Media Association (EMA) has a ""Green Seal"" for various categories, one of which being production. The EMA Green Seal recognizes programs honoring progress in sustainable production. The score for production practices is evaluated on a scale of  points, with  points being the lowest threshold to receive the Green Seal and  needed to receive the Gold Seal label. Evaluations are made on best practices in categories such as: production, accounting, art, assistant directors, camera, catering, construction, costume & wardrobe, craft service, electric, greens, grip, hair, locations, make-up, props, set decoration, special effects, sound, and transportation.
The Sustainable Production Forum gives away two awards annually: Sustainable Production Impact and Sustainable Production Champion. The Sustainable Production Impact Award recognizes productions that ""have had measurable reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and/or waste diversion and contributed positively to the local community"". The Sustainable Production Champion award recognizes individuals that ""go above and beyond to advance sustainable production in the motion picture industry"".Events featuring Sustainable Production
Sustainable Production Forum
The Sustainable Production Forum is the first and only forum to bring together leaders of the film industry to discuss sustainable practices in production, rather than simply environmental friendly content. The Sustainable Production Forum was launched in . It gives one type of award for recognized sustainable production champions (individuals) and one type of award for impacts (productions).Notable events that recognize environmental content are the EMA Awards and this list of environmental film festivals.
Examples of Sustainable Film Production
The X-Files
The X-Files Season  reboot diverted more than % of its total waste from landfills. In addition, % of the aluminum and steel used in set construction was recycled. A total of  tons of CO emissions were avoided, as well as , plastic bottles. The switch from bottles to jugs alone saved production by $,.Fifty Shades Freed
Fifty Shades Freed is the third movie in the ""Fifty Shades"" phenomenon. The film was filmed mainly in Vancouver, BC and the production worked hard to reduce their footprint. To begin, Fifty Shades Freed was shot consecutively with its predecessor Fifty Shades Darker which helped the production combine and reuse materials. Also, the crew eliminated plastic bottles and saved about , single use bottles. The set contained a comprehensive recycling and composing program, and had a dedicated Sustainability Production Assistant to take the point on that initiative which resulted in % of waste diverted from landfills. Set dressing and materials were donated to Habitat for Humanity ReStore, Great Northern Way Scene Shop, MakerLabs, and Squamish Arts Council at wrap. The Universal Pictures’ Assets Department worked with the Sustainable Lock Up in Vancouver and Recycled Movie Sets in Los Angeles to recirculate the stored sets from the trilogy for reuse and donation to local film schools, non-profits, and other productions. In total,  tons of set materials were donated to be reused and % of the trilogy's sets were kept out of landfills. Fifty Shades Freed was a recipient of a  EMA Green Seal Award.
Downton Abbey
When filming in the United Kingdom, the Downton Abbey film's production team did a number of things to reduce their footprint including sending call sheets, scripts, and production documents electronically, no disposable food service products on site, and recycling/composting. In addition, Carnival Films stored sets from the six seasons of the television series Downton Abbey that production was able to re-use or re-purpose to save the consumption of new materials. Disposables were also saved by issuing the crew reusable water bottles and the sound department used reusable batteries. At the conclusion of production, the costume department donated $ worth of fabric and materials to the Wimbledon College of Arts. Storage boxes and hangers were donated to local sewing and flower shops and set decoration donated produce to The Hounslow Urban Farm to be used to feed animals. Downton Abbey received a  EMA Green Seal.Yesterday
Yesterday implemented a strict-no idling policy to reduce CO emissions and many of the crew utilized public transportation. In addition to the sustainable practices, the set decoration team incorporated green messaging on the posters on the school set. The Yesterday team donated ,lbs of excess catering and set decoration to City Harvest London, feeding , in need. The construction department donated $, worth of leather tapestries to a firefighting charity.  Costumes and props were donated to Dress for Success and British Heart Foundation. Yesterday received a  EMA Gold Seal.Environmental Production Guides
Green Production Guide
The Green Production Guide was developed by the Producers Guild of America Foundation and PGAGreen.org with primary support from NBCUniversal, ViacomCBS, Amblin Partners, Sony Pictures Entertainment, HBO, Netflix, Amazon Studios, Disney, WarnerMedia, th Century Studios, CBS & Participant Media.The Green Production Guide includes a comprehensive database of vendors including info about their services, experience, and locations. The website additionally offers a Production Environmental Accounting Report (PEAR) that can be downloaded to aid production in analyzing their carbon footprint and the Production Environmental Actions Checklist (PEACH), which clarifies best practices in the industry.
Reel Green
Reel Green offers free carbon footprint literacy courses to members of the motion picture industry. The -hour workshops leave participants with knowledge on how to ""have a sound understanding of the science of climate change, understand how to act to reduce their impact, recognize the impact that production has on the environment, and have knowledge of the tools and techniques to lessen this impact"".See Also

== References ==A sustainable food system is a type of food system that provides healthy food to people and creates sustainable environmental, economic and social systems that surround food. Sustainable food systems start with the development of sustainable agricultural practices, development of more sustainable food distribution systems, creation of sustainable diets and reduction of food waste throughout the system. Sustainable food systems have been argued to be central to many or all  Sustainable Development Goals.

Moving to sustainable food systems, including via shifting consumption to sustainable diets, is an important component of addressing the causes of climate change and adapting to it. A  review conducted for the European Union found that up to % of global greenhouse gas emissions could be attributed to the food system, including crop and livestock production, transportation, changing land use (including deforestation) and food loss and waste. Reduction of meat production, which e.g. accounts for ~% of GHG emissions and ~% of agriculturally used land, is one major component of this change.The global food system is facing major interconnected challenges, including mitigating food insecurity, effects from climate change, biodiversity loss, malnutrition, inequity, soil degradation, pest outbreaks, water and energy scarcity, economic and political crises, natural resource depletion and preventable ill-health.The concept of sustainable food systems is frequently at the center of sustainability-focused policy programs, such as proposed Green New Deal programs.According to PIMS (profit impact of marketing strategy), an important lever of business success is growth. Among  variables, growth is mentioned as one of the most important variables for success: market share, market growth, marketing expense to sales ratio or a strong market position.The question how much growth is sustainable is answered by two concepts with different perspectives:

The sustainable growth rate (SGR) concept by Robert C. Higgins, describes optimal growth from a financial perspective assuming a given strategy with clear defined financial frame conditions/ limitations. Sustainable growth is defined as the annual percentage of increase in sales that is consistent with a defined financial policy (target debt to equity ratio, target dividend payout ratio, target profit margin, target ratio of total assets to net sales). This concept provides a comprehensive financial framework and formula for case/ company specific SGR calculations.
The optimal growth concept by Martin Handschuh, Hannes Lösch, Björn Heyden et al. assesses sustainable growth from a total shareholder return creation and profitability perspective—independent of a given strategy, business model and/ or financial frame condition. This concept is based on statistical long-term assessments and is enriched by case examples. It provides an orientation frame for case/ company specific mid- to long-term growth target setting.Sustainable Livelihood emerges at the intersection of development and environmental studies to offer a new way to think about work, especially the work of vulnerable populations (e.g., low income population living in the bottom of the pyramid, indigenous communities, etc.). The term reflects a concern with extending the focus of poverty studies beyond the physical manifestations of poverty to include also vulnerability and social exclusion.The term ""Sustainable"" refers to an individual's ability to provide for themselves in such a manner that is viably long. ""Sustainability"" also refers to the ability to undergo external shocks or stresses and recover from such traumas through maintaining or improving one's livelihood. The sustainable livelihood framework provides a structure for holistic poverty alleviation action. Common adaptations of a sustainable livelihood framework focus on dynamic, human-centered programs aimed at reducing poverty. COVID- in addition to other social, economic, and political crises, have made situations of the poor more difficult.Sustainable population refers to a proposed sustainable human population of Earth or a particular region of Earth, such as a nation or continent. Estimates vary widely, with estimates based on different figures ranging from . billion people to  billion, with  billion people being a typical estimate. Projections of population growth, evaluations of overconsumption and associated human pressures on the environment have led to some to advocate for what they consider a sustainable population. Proposed policy solutions vary, including sustainable development, female education, family planning and broad human population planning.
Emerging economies like those of China and India aspire to the living standards of the Western world, as does the non-industrialized world in general. As of , China and India account for most of the population in Asia, with more than . billion each. It is the combination of population increase in the developing world and unsustainable consumption levels in the developed world that poses a stark challenge to sustainability.According to the UN Population Fund, high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated, and the world's poorest countries also have the highest fertility and population growth rates.Sustainable procurement is a process whereby organizations meet their needs for goods, services, works and utilities in a way that achieves value for money on a life-cycle basis while addressing equity principles for sustainable development, therefore benefiting societies and the environment across time and geographies. Procurement is often conducted via a tendering or competitive bidding process. The process is used to ensure the buyer receives goods, services or works for the best possible price, when aspects such as quality, quantity, time, and location are compared. Procurement is considered sustainable when organizations broadens this framework by meeting their needs for goods, services, works, and utilities in a way that achieves value for money and promotes positive outcomes not only for the organization itself but for the economy, environment, and society. This framework is also known as the triple bottom line, which is a business accounting framework. The concept of TBL is narrowly prescribed, and even John Elkington, who coined the term in the s, now advocates its recall. Indeed, procurement practitioners have drawn attention to the fact that buying from smaller firms, locally, is an important aspect of sustainable procurement in the public sector. Ethics, culture, safety, diversity, inclusion, justice, human rights and the environment are additionally listed as important aspects of SPP.Sustainable procurement is a spending and investment process typically associated with public policy, although it is equally applicable to the private sector. Organizations practicing sustainable procurement meet their needs for goods, services, utilities and works not only on a private cost–benefit analysis, but also with the intention to maximizing net benefits for themselves and the wider world. In doing so they must incorporate extrinsic cost considerations into decisions alongside the conventional procurement criteria of price and quality, although in practice the sustainable impacts of a potential supplier's approach are often assessed as a form of quality consideration. These considerations are typically divided thus: environmental, economic and social, but it should go beyond and encompass a series of equity principles for sustainable development, such as intragenerational equity, intergenerational equity, interspecies equity, procedural equity, and geographical equity. These can be seen as the 'sustainability pillars' of procurement, which can be underpinned by one or several instruments for development, such as those proposed by Amartya Sen: () economic facilities, () social opportunities, () protective security, () political freedoms and () transparency guarantees. And to procure in a sustainable way involves looking beyond short-term needs and considering the longer-term impacts of each purchase. Sustainable procurement is used to ensure that purchasing reflects broader goals linked to resource efficiency, climate change, social responsibility and economic resilience, for example.Sustainable procurement involves a higher degree of collaboration and engagement between all parties in a supply chain. Many businesses have adopted a broad interpretation of sustainable procurement and have developed tools and techniques to support this engagement and collaboration.Sustainable tourism is a concept that covers the complete tourism experience, including concern for economic, social and environmental issues as well as attention to improving tourists' experiences and addressing the needs of host communities. Sustainable tourism should embrace concerns for environmental protection, social equity, and the quality of life, cultural diversity, and a dynamic, viable economy delivering jobs and prosperity for all. It has its roots in sustainable development and there can be some confusion as to what ""sustainable tourism"" means.:   There is now broad consensus that tourism should be sustainable. In fact, all forms of tourism have the potential to be sustainable if planned, developed and managed properly. Tourist development organizations are promoting sustainable tourism practices in order to mitigate negative effects caused by the growing impact of tourism, for example its environmental impacts.

The United Nations World Tourism Organization emphasized these practices by promoting sustainable tourism as part of the Sustainable Development Goals, through programs like the International Year for Sustainable Tourism for Development in . There is a direct link between sustainable tourism and several of the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).:   Tourism for SDGs focuses on how SDG  (""decent work and economic growth""), SDG  (""responsible consumption and production"") and SDG  (""life below water"") implicate tourism in creating a sustainable economy. According to the World Travel & Tourism Travel, tourism constituted "". percent to the global gross domestic product, with international tourist arrivals hitting . billion marks (a growth of . percent) in "" and generated $. trillion export earnings yet, improvements are expected to be gained from suitable management aspects and including sustainable tourism as part of a broader sustainable development strategy.Together for Sustainability AISBL (TfS) is a joint initiative of chemical companies, founded in . It focuses on the promotion of sustainability practices in the chemical industry's supply chain, currently gathering chemical companies around a single standard of auditing and assessment.The triple bottom line (or otherwise noted as TBL or BL) is an accounting framework with three parts: social, environmental (or ecological) and economic. Some organizations have adopted the TBL framework to evaluate their performance in a broader perspective to create greater business value. Business writer John Elkington claims to have coined the phrase in .The Vermont Dairy Festival is a yearly festival in Enosburg Falls, Vermont traditionally held on the first weekend of June that is devoted to the Vermont dairy industry."
1,human rights,"Human rights are moral principles or norms for certain standards of human behaviour and are regularly protected in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable, fundamental rights ""to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being"" and which are ""inherent in all human beings"", regardless of their age, ethnic origin, location, language, religion, ethnicity, or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone. They are regarded as requiring empathy and the rule of law and imposing an obligation on persons to respect the human rights of others, and it is generally considered that they should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances.The doctrine of human rights has been highly influential within international law and global and regional institutions. Actions by states and non-governmental organisations form a basis of public policy worldwide. The idea of human rights suggests that ""if the public discourse of peacetime global society can be said to have a common moral language, it is that of human rights"". The strong claims made by the doctrine of human rights continue to provoke considerable scepticism and debates about the content, nature and justifications of human rights to this day. The precise meaning of the term right is controversial and is the subject of continued philosophical debate; while there is consensus that human rights encompasses a wide variety of rights such as the right to a fair trial, protection against enslavement, prohibition of genocide, free speech or a right to education, there is disagreement about which of these particular rights should be included within the general framework of human rights; some thinkers suggest that human rights should be a minimum requirement to avoid the worst-case abuses, while others see it as a higher standard. It has also been argued that human rights are ""God-given"", although this notion has been criticized.Many of the basic ideas that animated the human rights movement developed in the aftermath of the Second World War and the events of the Holocaust, culminating in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Paris by the United Nations General Assembly in . Ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights. The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition that became prominent during the European Enlightenment with such philosophers as John Locke, Francis Hutcheson and Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui and which featured prominently in the political discourse of the American Revolution and the French Revolution. From this foundation, the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the th century, possibly as a reaction to slavery, torture, genocide and war crimes, as a realisation of inherent human vulnerability and as being a precondition for the possibility of a just society. Human rights advocacy has continued into the early st century, centred around achieving greater economic and political freedom.Civil rights leaders are influential figures in the promotion and implementation of political freedom and the expansion of personal civil liberties and rights. They work to protect individuals and groups from political repression and discrimination by governments and private organizations, and seek to ensure the ability of all members of society to participate in the civil and political life of the state.

The campaign runs every year from  November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, to  December, Human Rights Day. 
Originally called the "" Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence"" campaign, it was initiated in  by the first Women's Global Leadership Institute, held by the Center for Women's Global Leadership (CWGL), at Rutgers University.Since , more than , organizations from approximately  countries have participated in the campaign.During the Egyptian revolution of , several female protestors at Tahrir Square were taken into military custody and subjected to torture and virginity tests.
Protestors were evacuated from Tahrir Square on March  and military police took at least  women into military custody, where they were beaten, electrocuted, and subjected to searches after being stripped, while male soldiers photographed them, and then subjected them to virginity tests and threatened them with prostitution chargings.In , the court ruled the acquittal of Ahmed Adel, a recruited doctor in the Egyptian Army who conducted the operation to examine the activists' virginity.The  California prisoner hunger strike started on July ,  involving over , inmates in protest of the state's use of solitary confinement practices and ended on  September , . The hunger strike was organized by inmates in long term solitary in the Security Housing Unit (SHU) at Pelican Bay State Prison in protest of inmates housed there that were in solitary confinement indefinitely for having ties to gangs. Another hunger strike that added to the movement started the week before in High Desert State Prison. The focus of the High Desert State Prison hunger strike was to demand cleaner facilities, better food and better access to the library.Due to the two-month hunger strike, lawmakers agreed to hold public hearings on the conditions within California's maximum security prisons where this prolonged solitary confinement has taken place. Following this announcement, a week later on September , , there were  inmates in two prisons on a hunger strike;  of them had been on a hunger strike continuously since July . All remaining hunger strikers, in light of the lawmaker's promise, resumed eating on September , .An adequate remedy or adequate remedy at law is part of a legal remedy (either court-ordered or negotiated between the litigants) which the court deems satisfactory, without recourse to an equitable remedy This consideration expresses to the court whether money should be awarded or a court order should be decreed.. Adequate remedy at law refers to the sufficient compensation for the loss or damages caused by the defendant with a proper monetary award. The court must grant the adequacy of remedy that will lead to a ""meaningful hearing"". Whether legal damages or equitable relief are requested depends largely on,whether or not the remedy can be valued. Both two elements, compensation and the meaningfulness of hearing, provide a proper way to have an adequate remedy. The word ""meaningfulness"" of hearing in the law process is the assumption that the defendant compensated must be meaningful for the injured party where the defendant made a fully covered compensation for all the losses. Hence, the hearing in which cannot give any right amount of compensation award or settlement is not ""meaningful"", and the unavailability of the compensation will lead to an inadequate remedy. The adequate remedy at law is the legal remedies by meaning it is satisfactory compensation by way of monetary damages without granting equitable remedies.As an operation of law, an attorney often must present to the court whether there is an adequate remedy. This would be a basic principle of equity. When a monetary award is not an adequate or appropriate remedy, equity can order a ""specific performance"", an order of the court requiring a party to perform the obligations that he or she undertook to perform under the contract. The ""specific performance"" exists when there is an exchange under a contract that can not be found easily elsewhere or at all, such as antiques, parcels of land.

Saudi Arabia, spearheading a coalition of nine Arab states, began carrying out airstrikes in neighbouring Yemen and imposing an aerial and naval blockade on  March , heralding a military intervention code-named Operation Decisive Storm  (Arabic: عملية عاصفة الحزم, romanized: Amaliyyat `Āṣifat al-Ḥazm).  More than  health facilities() in Yemen have been destroyed by a series of airstrikes conducted by the Saudi Arabian-led coalition since March .   Many of these have been public health hospitals staffed or supported by Doctors Without Borders (MSF).  Critics of the assaults say the airstrikes are war crimes in violation of the protections of health care facilities afforded by the internationally recognized rules of war and have called for independent investigations.Many other civilians targets, including schools, and school buses in Yemen are also bombed by the Saudi-led coalition.According to a report by the United Nations in , , schools were damaged, destroyed, or unused during the Yemeni Civil War.The UN accused the Saudi-led coalition of ""complete disregard for human life"".The Allard Prize for International Integrity is one of the world's largest prizes dedicated to the fight against corruption and the protection of human rights. The prize is awarded biennially to an individual, movement or organization that has ""demonstrated exceptional courage and leadership in combating corruption, especially through promoting transparency, accountability and the Rule of Law."" The winner receives the Allard Prize Award, a uniquely crafted brass artwork, and CAD$,. Honourable mention recipients are awarded a unique nickel-plated artwork, and may also receive a cash award.
At the  Award Ceremony, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Glenn Greenwald stated that the Allard Prize “is important … and isn't devoted just to honouring anti-corruption crusaders, but to constructing and fortifying a framework that really does protect them and enables the work to proceed much more safely,"" and ""this kind of courage can be very contagious."" Past Allard Prize winners and others have said that the Allard Prize assists, supports and protects those working in anti-corruption and their work. Canada's National Observer calls The Allard Prize 'The Oscars of anti-corruption'.The Allard Prize and Allard Prize Foundation, the charitable organization that supports the Allard Prize, were founded in  and are funded by lawyer and businessman Peter A. Allard, Q.C. The Allard Prize Committee is responsible for the oversight, organization and selection of the Prize winner and honourable mention recipients. From  until June ,  the Prize was administered at the Peter A. Allard School of Law at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. The Allard Prize is now independent of UBC.Some Allard Prize nominees and winners have previously been subjected to threats, violence, torture, imprisonment and other attacks associated with their anti-corruption and human rights activities.  Allard Prize co-recipient Daphne Caruana Galizia and  honourable mention recipient Sergei Magnitsky both received the Allard Prize posthumously. Maltese journalist Caruna-Galizia was assassinated by car bomb in . Russian auditor Magnitsky died after being tortured in prison.Amnesty International Nepal (also referred to as Amnesty Nepal or AI Nepal) was founded in Nepal in  by Nutan Thapaliya as an affiliate of the global human rights movement Amnesty International. Two years later, AI Nepal received the status of a ""section"" at the International Council Meeting (ICM) of Amnesty International in . Due to the difficult environment caused by the repressive Panchyat regime and other difficulties, AI Nepal was dissolved as a Section in . However, the Amnesty movement survived and continued to thrive on in Nepal at the membership level as the very committed members at the groups level continued to engage in different activities to further the AI’s vision in Nepal and elsewhere. After the restoration of democracy in , the AI movement gained further strength in Nepal, and a Coordinating Structure led by Mr Chitra Niraula was constituted by the International Secretariat. The AI movement in Nepal was again recognized as a Section of Amnesty International in . Since then, AI Nepal has been actively engaged in furthering the human rights in Nepal and around the globe by keeping its membership base vibrant, agile and responsive. Currently, AI Nepal has over seven thousand active members affiliated through its various local structures such as Groups and Youth Networks.  
Amnesty Nepal envisions a world where every person enjoys all human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as well as within other international human rights standards and norms. In order to achieve this, Amnesty Nepal strives to undertake research and action-focused advocacy campaigns to prevent and end all forms of human rights abuses.Amnesty Nepal is a constituent of the global community of human rights defenders with values of international solidarity, effective action for victims, global coverage, universality and indivisibility of human rights, and with impartiality and independence as the driving factors in this global movement.The Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial is a . acres (. ha) cenotaph complex and educational park in Boise, Idaho near the Boise Public Library and the Greenbelt, the centerpiece of which is a statue of Anne Frank; it is jointly maintained by the Wassmuth Center for Human Rights and the Boise Department of Parks and Recreation, and is the only human rights memorial in the U.S. Designed by Idaho Falls architect Kurt Karst, a sapling of the Anne Frank Tree and quotations from some sixty notables and unknowns (including poets, activists, politicians and diplomats, those who survived the Holocaust, and those who did not) are prominent installations. It also features one of the few installations where the full text of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is on permanent public display. The park has been recognized and accepted by the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience. It was thoroughly renovated in September , with an outdoor classroom and a new sculpture, ""The Spiral of Injustice.""Museum researcher Brigitte Sion has written that in seeking to use Anne Frank as a symbol for various universal and parochial issues, the memorial offers a sanitized version of Anne Frank that denies the reality of her history. Sion writes ""Nothing in the Boise memorial's mission statement, its official literature, or at the site itself directly identifies Anne Frank as a Jewish victim of the Holocaust or explains the reason for her hiding, let alone for her arrest, deportation, and death in a Nazi concentration camp"".The site not only serves as a convenient staging area for rallies, marches, and protests (and more generally as a contemplative spot), it is where the Boise Police Department takes their newly commissioned officers before field training.Article  of the Moroccan Penal Code (Arabic: الفصل  من القانون الجنائي المغربي) criminalizes extramarital sexual relations in Morocco.Asia Centre is an independent research institute based in Paris, France, that conducts discussions and produces publications on the strategic and economic aspects of international relations as well as current political and social transformations in the Asia-Pacific region.

The conference was held for the first time in  but could not held in  due to the COVID- pandemic. The conference is attended by a large number of journalists, lawyers, political leaders, human rights activists, labor leaders, intellectuals and students from all over Pakistan, as well as many officials from foreign countries. Asia program coordinator of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Steven Butler, was deported from Lahore Airport citing the ""stop list"" in .

An asylum seeker is an immigrant who has been forcibly displaced and might have fled their home country because of war or other factors harming them or their family. If their case is accepted, they become considered a refugee. The terms asylum seeker, refugee and illegal immigrant are often confused.
A person becomes an asylum seeker by making a formal application for the right to remain in another country and keeps that status until the application has been concluded. The relevant immigration authorities of the country of asylum determine whether the asylum seeker will be granted protection and become an officially recognized refugee or whether asylum will be refused and the asylum seeker becomes an illegal immigrant who may be asked to leave the country and may even be deported.
In North American English, the term asylee is also used. An asylee can either be an asylum seeker, as defined above, or a person whose claim for asylum was accepted and asylum was granted. On average, about  million people apply for asylum every year.The asylum seeker may be recognised as a refugee and given refugee status if their circumstances fall into the definition of refugee according to the  Refugee Convention or other refugee laws—such as the European Convention on Human Rights, if asylum is claimed within the European Union. However, signatories to the refugee convention create their own policies for assessing the protection status of asylum seekers, and the proportion of asylum applicants who are accepted or rejected varies each year from country to country.Baháʼu'lláh, the prophet-founder of the Baháʼí Faith, called for global agreement on human rights protection nearly eighty years before the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in . He taught that ""an equal standard of human rights must be recognized and adopted.” Baháʼu'lláh called for governments to protect the human rights of their populations and to ensure their welfare. To safeguard human rights, Bahá'u'lláh urged global leaders to establish a world commonwealth that would include a system of collective security to protect populations against tyranny and oppression.The Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct are standards for ethical conduct of judges.The six core values are:

== References ==Birthright is the concept of things being due to a person upon or by fact of their birth, or due to the order of their birth. These may include rights of citizenship based on the place where the person was born or the citizenship of their parents, and inheritance rights to property owned by parents or others.
The concept of a birthright is ancient, and is often defined in part with concepts of both patriarchy and birth order. For example, ""[t]hroughout the Bible the concept of a birthright is absolutely intertwined with the firstborn. That is, the firstborn inherits the birthright and has expectations of primogeniture"", which historically referred to the right, by law or custom, of the firstborn legitimate child to inherit the parent's entire or main estate in preference to shared inheritance among all or some children, any illegitimate child or any collateral relative. In the seventeenth century, English activist John Lilburne used the term with respect to the rights of Englishmen ""to connote all that is due to a citizen"" of England, which ""is claimed from English law to higher authorities"". The term was similarly popularized in India by self-rule advocate Bal Gangadhar Tilak in the s, when Tilak adopted the slogan coined by his associate Kaka Baptista: ""Swaraj (self-rule) is my birthright and I shall have it."" The term then ""attained the status of a political slogan"".In the context of the rights of citizenship, ""[t]he term birthright signals not only that membership is acquired at birth or on grounds of birth, but also that membership is presumptively a lifelong status for the individual and continuous across generations for the citizenry as a collective"". Birthright citizenship  has long been a feature of English common law. Calvin's Case, was particularly important as it established that, under English common law, ""a person's status was vested at birth, and based upon place of birth—a person born within the king's dominion owed allegiance to the sovereign, and in turn, was entitled to the king's protection.""
This same principle was accepted by the United States as being ""ancient and fundamental"", i.e., well-established common law, as stated by the Supreme Court in its  interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in United States v. Wong Kim Ark: ""the Fourteenth Amendment affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and under the protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens, with the exceptions or qualifications (as old as the rule itself) of children of foreign sovereigns or their ministers, or born on foreign public ships, or of enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory, and with the single additional exception of children of members of the Indian tribes owing direct allegiance to their several tribes"".The concept of birthright descending from participation in a particular culture is demonstrated in the Birthright Israel program, initiated in . The program provides free trips to visit Israel to persons who have at least one parent of recognized Jewish descent, or who have converted to Judaism through a recognized Jewish movement, and who do not actively practice another religion. They must also be between the ages  to , post-high-school, have neither traveled to Israel before on a peer educational trip or study program past the age of  nor have lived in Israel past the age of .Nomarussia Bonase (born ) is a South African human rights activist.The British Post Office scandal is a miscarriage of justice involving the wrongful civil and criminal prosecutions of an unknown or unpublished number of sub-postmasters (SPMs) for theft, false accounting and/or fraud. The cases constitute the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history, spanning a period of over twenty years and it remains unresolved.After some convicted SPMs successfully sued the Post Office,  convictions were declared unsafe and to have been obtained unlawfully. By ,  prosecutions had been identified,  convictions had been overturned and more were expected to be quashed. The number of those affected by other types of abuse by the Post Office, torts, breach of contract, coercion etc., has not been tabulated or published. The prosecutions, civil actions, and extortions resulted in criminal convictions, false confessions, imprisonments, defamation, loss of livelihood, bankruptcy, divorce, and suicide.In , International Computers Limited (ICL) began working on a computer accounting system, called Horizon, for the publicly-owned Post Office corporation. By , ICL  was part of Fujitsu. In , the problems began with Horizon's introduction, which wrongly detected the existence of financial discrepancies at multiple post office branches. Second Sight's (forensic accountants) report of  described the Horizon Computer System as not fit for purpose, whilst the Post Office stated that ""there is absolutely no evidence of any systemic issues with the computer system"". The Post Office terminated the Initial Complaint Review and Mediation Scheme in  and published a report clearing themselves of any wrongdoing.The Post Office has a single shareholder, the British Government. Initially, the government refused to pay any compensation; both the Post Office and government repeatedly stated that the money awarded when the SPMs sued the Post Office was a full and final settlement. After appeals by MPs in , the government promised financial compensation to the victims of the scandal, as the Post Office itself did not have sufficient resources.The Post Office set up a separate historic shortfall scheme that went on to attract more than , claims. The scheme excluded the  SPMs who had successfully sued the post office. As of February , no commitment to compensate those  SPMs existed. On  March , a government scheme was launched to compensate the  SPMs at the same level of compensation as other SPMs.In , the government initiated an independent inquiry, led by retired judge Wyn Williams. After two initial hearings, it was converted to a public inquiry in June . In November it held a preliminary 'List of Issues Hearing' and, in February , commenced a series of 'Human Impact Hearings' investigating whether the Post Office and software supplier Fujitsu knew about the faults in the IT system, which led to criminal convictions and civil proceedings against staff, which have subsequently been quashed. The inquiry hopes to be completed by Autumn .The Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam (CDHRI) is a declaration of the member states of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) first adopted in Cairo, Egypt, on  August , (Conference of Foreign Ministers, – Muharram H in the Islamic calendar), and later revised in  and adopted on  November  (Council of Foreign Ministers at its th session in Niamey, Republic of Niger).  It provides an overview on the Islamic perspective on human rights.  The  version affirms Islamic sharia as its sole source, whereas the  version doesn't specifically invoke sharia.  The focus of this article is the  version of the CDHRI.  
The CDHRI declares its purpose to be ""general guidance for Member States [of the OIC] in the field of human rights"".  This declaration is widely acknowledged as an Islamic response to the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted in . It guarantees some, but not all, of the UDHR and serves as a living document of human rights guidelines prescribed for all members of the OIC to follow, but restricts them explicitly to the limits set by the sharia. Because of this limit, the CDHRI has been criticized as an attempt to shield OIC member states from international criticism for human rights violations, as well as for failing to guarantee freedom of religion, justifying corporal punishment and allowing discrimination against non-Muslims and women.Capital punishment has been completely abolished in all European countries except for Belarus and Russia, the latter of which has a moratorium and has not conducted an execution since September . The complete ban on capital punishment is enshrined in both the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU) and two widely adopted protocols of the European Convention on Human Rights of the Council of Europe, and is thus considered a central value. Of all modern European countries, San Marino, Portugal, and the Netherlands were the first to abolish capital punishment, whereas only Belarus still practises capital punishment in some form or another. In , Latvia became the last EU member state to abolish capital punishment in wartime.In Russia, capital punishment has been indefinitely suspended (under moratorium) since .Except for Belarus, which, most recently, carried out one execution in , the last execution occurred in Ukraine in .Carson & Another v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [] EWCA Civ  was heard in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) in the Supreme Court on  June  before Lord Justice Brown, Lord Justice Laws, and Lord Justice Rix.
Two separate High Court cases were brought together for the purposes of this appeal: R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions & Another, from the Administration Court of the Queens Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in England and Wales before The Honourable Mr. Justice Burnton, and R (Reynolds) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, from the Administration Court of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in England and Wales before Mr. Justice Wilson.

The CMC system is going to be set up in each major state collocated with the TERM Cells.  Telecom operators in India are required by law to give access to their networks to law enforcement agencies.

The Indian Government set up the Centralized Monitoring System (CMS) to automate the process of government-approved Lawful Interception & Monitoring of telecommunications. The Cabinet Committee on Security  approved the project of CMS with government funding of INR  Crores. Pilot trials have been completed and the system is anticipated to be progressively implemented from the end of the financial year.In keeping with the Paris Principles definition of a child soldier, the Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative defines a child pirate' as any person below  years of age who is or who has been recruited or used by a pirate gang in any capacity, including children - boys and/or girls - used as gunmen in boarding parties, hostage guards, negotiators, ship captains, messengers, spies or for sexual purposes, whether at sea or on land.  It does not only refer to a child who is taking or has taken a direct part in kinetic criminal operations.
Children may volunteer to participate in piratical activities (usually on account of socioeconomic desperation, familial suggestion or peer influence) or they may be forcibly abducted by piratical gangs.From  to , the Cingranelli-Richards (CIRI) Human Rights Data Project annually rated the level of government respect for a variety of internationally recognized human rights. The final CIRI data set contains quantitative indicators of  human rights for  countries, annually from  to . The CIRI data were used in over  countries by scholars, students, policymakers, and analysts representing over  organizations. CIRI's founders and co-directors were political scientists David Cingranelli at Binghamton University, SUNY  and David L. Richards at the University of Connecticut. K. Chad Clay at the University of Georgia joined as third co-director in .The Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit, variously called Citizens Armed Forces Geographical Unit, Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit and commonly referred to by its acronym CAFGU (pronounced ""kahf-goo"") is an irregular auxiliary force of the Armed Forces of the Philippines with total strength of , personnel as of .Civil death (Latin: civiliter mortuus) is the loss of all or almost all civil rights by a person due to a conviction for a felony or due to an act by the government of a country that results in the loss of civil rights. It is usually inflicted on persons convicted of crimes against the state or adults determined by a court to be legally incompetent because of mental disability.In medieval Europe, felons lost all civil rights upon their conviction. This civil death often led to actual death, since anyone could kill and injure a felon with impunity. Under the Holy Roman Empire, a person declared civilly dead was referred to as vogelfrei ('free as a bird') and could even be killed since they were completely outside the law.Historically outlawry, that is, declaring a person as an outlaw, was a common form of civil death.In the US, the disenfranchisement of felons has been called a form of civil death, as has being subjected to collateral consequences in general. The contention is not generally supported by legal scholars. Civil death as such remains part of the law in New York, Rhode Island and the Virgin Islands.A civil rights referendum or human rights referendum is any act of direct democracy which allows for a vote on the granting or amendment of current civil rights, liberties or associations as recognized by a government. Such referendums have frequently been proposed as a means by which the majority of the voting public in a polity, rather than the judicial or legislative chambers of government, could determine what the state should recognize or carry out, while such referendums have been strongly criticized by civil rights organizations and professional bodies as means by which the majority of the public could vote on the rights of a vulnerable minority according to contemporary prejudices.Cognitive liberty, or the ""right to mental self-determination"", is the freedom of an individual to control their own mental processes, cognition, and consciousness. It has been argued to be both an extension of, and the principle underlying, the right to freedom of thought. Though a relatively recently defined concept, many theorists see cognitive liberty as being of increasing importance as technological advances in neuroscience allow for an ever-expanding ability to directly influence consciousness. Cognitive liberty is not a recognized right in any international human rights treaties, but has gained a limited level of recognition in the United States, and is argued to be the principle underlying a number of recognized rights.On December , , the National Assembly of the Republic of Azerbaijan adopted the Constitutional Law on the Commissioner for Human Rights (Ombudsman) of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and on March , , the President signed a Decree on the application of this Law and, thus, creation and functioning of the legal framework.The Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland is set up as a non-departmental public body, established by the  Commissioner for Older People Act (Northern Ireland) . The Commissioner has a number of legal functions and powers directly linked to the legislation. The Commissioner's office is sponsored by the Executive Office of Northern Ireland.

The current Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland is Eddie Lynch.Communication rights involve freedom of opinion and expression, democratic media governance, media ownership and media control, participation in one's own culture, linguistic rights, rights to education, privacy,  assemble, and self-determination.  They are also related inclusion and exclusion,  quality and accessibility to  means of communication.A ""right to communicate"" and ""communication rights"" are closely related, but not identical. The former is more associated with the New World Information and Communication Order debate, and points to the need for a formal legal acknowledgment of such a right, as an overall framework for more effective implementation. The latter emphasizes the fact that an array of international rights underpinning communication already exists, but many are often ignored and require active mobilization and assertion.The consistent life ethic, also known as the consistent ethic of life or whole life ethic, is an ideology that opposes abortion, capital punishment, assisted suicide, and euthanasia. Adherents oppose war, or at the very least, unjust war; some adherents go as far as full pacifism and so oppose all war. Many authors have understood the ethic to be relevant to a broad variety of areas of public policy as well as social justice issues.The term was popularized in  by the Catholic prelate Joseph Bernardin to express an ideology based on the premise that all human life is sacred and should be protected by law.Correlative (""corelative,"" UK spelling) is the term adopted by Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld to describe the philosophical relationships between fundamental legal concepts in jurisprudence.Holding corporations accountable for either direct conduct or complicity for human rights violations has become an increasing area of attention in promoting human rights. Multinational corporations in particular have been singled out as important figures, for better or worse, in the maintenance of human rights given their economic status and international dimension. As it currently stands there is no mechanism at the international level which can hold corporations legally accountable. Reliance has instead been placed upon a number of soft law instruments the most important one of which is the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. With the potential exception for redress under the Alien Tort Statute corporations are only legally accountable for human rights violations under the municipal law of the Nation in which the violation is alleged to have occurred or the company is based.The cultural rights movement has provoked attention to protect the rights of groups of people, or their culture, in similar fashion to the manner in which the human rights movement has brought attention to the needs of individuals throughout the world.The New Delhi Congress or Declaration of Delhi was an international gathering of over  judges, lawyers, and law professors from  countries all over the world, united as the International Commission of Jurists that took place in New Delhi, India in .

The Congress further developed the principles and procedures underlying the Rule of Law as well as defining and clarifying the concept itself.A declaration of incompatibility in UK constitutional law is a declaration issued by a United Kingdom judge that a statute is incompatible with the European Convention of Human Rights under the Human Rights Act  section . This is a central part of UK constitutional law. Very few declarations of incompatibility have been issued, in comparison to the number of challenges.The Declaration of the Rights of the Child, sometimes known as the Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child, is an international document promoting child rights, drafted by Eglantyne Jebb and adopted by the League of Nations in , and adopted in an extended form by the United Nations in .The Declaration of Tokyo is a set of international guidelines for physicians concerning torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in relation to detention and imprisonment, which was adopted in October  during the th General assembly of the World Medical Association, and later editorially updated by the WMA in France, May  and . It declares torture to be ""contrary to the laws of humanity"",  and antithetical to the ""higher purpose"" of the physician, which is to ""alleviate the distress of his or her fellow human being."" The policy states that doctors should refuse to participate in, condone, or give permission for torture, degradation, or cruel treatment of prisoners or detainees. According to the policy, a prisoner who refuses to eat should not be fed artificially against their will, provided that they are judged to be rational.The Declaration on Crimes of Communism is a declaration signed on  February  by several prominent European politicians, former political prisoners, human rights advocates and historians, which calls for the condemnation of communism.The DeGoogle movement (also called the de-Google movement) is a grassroots campaign that has spawned as privacy advocates urge users to stop using Google products entirely due to growing privacy concerns regarding the company. The term refers to the act of removing Google from one's life. As the growing market share of the internet giant creates monopolistic power for the company in digital spaces, increasing numbers of journalists have noted the difficulty to find alternatives to the company's products. Some projects, such as ungoogled-chromium, primarily distinguish themselves from Google-maintained products by their lessened dependence on the company's infrastructure. It can be seen as part of a broader opposition to big tech companies, sometimes referred to as ""techlash.""The relationship between democracy and human rights has been extensively discussed by political theorists. Part of the issue is that both ""democracy"" and ""human rights"" are contested concepts whose exact definition and scope is subject to ongoing dispute. Views include human rights as an integral part of democracy, human rights requiring democracy, and mutual support between both concepts.In human rights law, derogability is whether the right may be infringed in certain circumstances. A non-derogable right is one whose infringement is not justified under any circumstances, generally right to life and freedom from torture, inhuman, or degrading treatment.

The document was born of a fraternal open discussion between Francis and Tayeb and is concerned with how different faiths can live peacefully in the same world, and it is meant to be a guide on advancing a ""culture of mutual respect"".
The Higher Committee of Human Fraternity has been established instituted to fulfill the aspirations of the Document on Human Fraternity internationally. The principles of compassion and human solidarity embodied in this text are the same ones that later inspired the declaration designating February  as the International Day of Human Fraternity, as indicated by UN Secretary-General António Guterres.In his  encyclical Fratelli tutti, Pope Francis stated that the Document on Human Fraternity ""was no mere diplomatic gesture, but a reflection born of dialogue and common commitment.""Dropmire  is a surveillance program by the United States' National Security Agency (NSA) aimed at surveillance of foreign embassies and diplomatic staff, including those of NATO allies. The program's existence was revealed in June  by whistleblower Edward Snowden in The Guardian newspaper. The report reveals that at least  foreign embassies were under surveillance, some of them as far back as .
Earlier in June , The Guardian had reported that the NSA spied on diplomats during the  G- London Summit, but no precise program name was revealed at the time.Diplomatic spying by the United States had been revealed as far back as , when it was revealed that US agencies had spied on the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon – at the time, it was not known that this had been done as part of a systematic program.The Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development, also known as the Dublin Principles, was a meeting of experts on water related problems that took place on  January  at the International Conference on Water and the Environment (ICWE), Dublin, Ireland, organised on – January .

Participants compete to throw the person with dwarfism the farthest. Dwarf Tossing was started in Australia as a form of pub entertainment in the early s. A related formerly practiced activity was dwarf-bowling, in which a person with dwarfism was placed on a skateboard and used as a bowling ball.Since its inception in the s, the activity, due to its problematic name and nature has been highly controversial and remains so in the early st century.The Edict of Milan (Latin: Edictum Mediolanense; Greek: Διάταγμα τῶν Μεδιολάνων, Diatagma tōn Mediolanōn) was the February  AD agreement to treat Christians benevolently within the Roman Empire. Western Roman Emperor Constantine I and Emperor Licinius, who controlled the Balkans, met in Mediolanum (modern-day Milan) and, among other things, agreed to change policies towards Christians following the edict of toleration issued by Emperor Galerius two years earlier in Serdica. The Edict of Milan gave Christianity legal status and a reprieve from persecution but did not make it the state church of the Roman Empire. That occurred in AD  with the Edict of Thessalonica.
The document is found in Lactantius's De mortibus persecutorum and in Eusebius of Caesarea's History of the Church with marked divergences between the two. Whether or not there was a formal 'Edict of Milan'  is no longer really debated among scholars who generally reject the story as it has come down in church history.The version found in Lactantius is not in the form of an edict. It is a letter from Licinius to the governors of the provinces in the Eastern Empire he had just conquered by defeating Maximinus later in the same year and issued in Nicomedia.Egalitarianism (from French  égal 'equal'), or equalitarianism, is a school of thought within political philosophy that builds from the concept of social equality, prioritizing it for all people. Egalitarian doctrines are generally characterized by the idea that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or moral status. Egalitarianism is the doctrine that all citizens of a state should be accorded exactly equal rights. Egalitarian doctrines have motivated many modern social movements and ideas, including the Enlightenment, feminism, civil rights, and international human rights.The term egalitarianism has two distinct definitions in modern English, either as a political doctrine that all people should be treated as equals and have the same political, economic, social and civil rights, or as a social philosophy advocating the removal of economic inequalities among people, economic egalitarianism, or the decentralization of power. Sources define egalitarianism as equality reflecting the natural state of humanity.Elder rights are the rights of older adults(usually those in the seventh decade of life or older, although this definition is disputed), who in various countries are not recognized as a constitutionally protected class, yet face discrimination across many aspects of society due to their age.
Common rights issues faced by elders include age-related job discrimination (such as forced age of retirement), lack of access to medical treatments, because of age or age-related obstacles, societal perceptions of ability/disability due to age, and vulnerability to abuse, including financial, physical, psychological, social, and sexual abuse, because of diminished capacity and lack of access to/ability to use technology.One of the earliest efforts by the US federal government to protect financial rights of elders was the establishment of Social Security benefits via the Social Security Act in , providing income to retired individuals who qualify.Electoral integrity refers to international standards and global norms governing the appropriate conduct of elections.These standards have been endorsed in a series of authoritative conventions, treaties, protocols, and guidelines by agencies of the international community, notably by the decisions of the UN General Assembly, by regional bodies such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Organization of American States (OAS), and the African Union (AU), and by member states in the United Nations. Following endorsement, these standards apply universally to all countries throughout the electoral cycle, including during the pre-electoral period, the campaign, on polling day, and in its aftermath.Ethnic penalty in sociology is defined as the economic and non-economic disadvantages that ethnic minorities experience in the labour market compared to other ethnic groups. As an area of study among behavioral economists, psychologists, and sociologists, it ranges beyond discrimination to take non-cognitive factors into consideration for explaining unwarranted differences between individuals of similar abilities but differing ethnicities.The European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation (EIUC) is an interdisciplinary centre covering the area of human rights education and research formed by  universities from all European Union member states. The EIUC's activities include interdisciplinary education of students worldwide; developing training for senior officials of international organisations, field personnel, and other human rights professionals; identifying means of transferring academic expertise to the public, such as using visual arts and mass media; creating an environment for research cooperation; representing a network of graduates of the European Master's Programme in Human Rights and Democratisation. The centre is housed in the Monastery of San Nicolò al Lido which has been made available to the EIUC by the Municipality of Venice, Italy.Crimes Committed by Totalitarian Regimes are reports and proceedings of the European public hearing organised by the Slovenian Presidency  of the Council of the European Union (January–June ) and the European Commission. The Hearing was organised in response to the request made by the Justice and Home Affairs Council of the European Union on  April .

Edited by Peter Jambrek and published by the Slovenian Presidency of the Council of the European Union Crimes, the reports and proceedings research and investigate gross and large scale human rights violations committed during the reign of totalitarian regimes in Europe.
There were four sessions at the Hearing: 

How to improve knowledge about totalitarian crimes?
How to promote public awareness about totalitarian crimes?
What lessons can be drawn from successful experiences?
How to achieve reconciliation?The preface was written by the Slovenian Minister of Justice Lovro Šturm, and the introduction by Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the European Commission for Justice, Freedom and Security. Countries that were involved were: Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovenia, Poland and Spain.The European Public Hearing on European Conscience and Crimes of Totalitarian Communism:  Years After was a European public hearing organised by the Czech Presidency of the European Union in the European Parliament on  March . The hearing was described by the Presidency as ""the third step towards the establishment of a European Platform of Memory and Conscience to support the activities of institutions engaged in reconciling with totalitarian regimes in Europe.""The hearing was hosted by the Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs Alexandr Vondra and the Permanent Representative of the Czech Republic to the European Union Milena Vicenová on behalf of the Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union, in cooperation with MEPs supporting the Prague Declaration.The first session, chaired by Tunne Kelam MEP, included speeches by Pavel Žáček (Director, Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes), Emmanuel Crabit (European Commission Directorate-General of Justice, Freedom and Security), Emanuelis Zingeris (Chairman, International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania), Marius Oprea (Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes in Romania), Hans Altendorf (Office of the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records), Vasil Kadrinov (Hannah Arendt Center), Nicolas Werth (Institute for Contemporary History, CNRS), and Camilla Andersson (Institute for Information on the Crimes of Communism).
The second session, chaired by Jana Hybášková MEP, included speeches by Alexandr Vondra (Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs of the Czech Republic), Ján Figeľ (European Commissioner for Education), Alejo Vidal-Quadras MEP (Vice President of the European Parliament), Jan Zahradil MEP, László Tökés MEP, and Sandra Kalniete (former European Commissioner).
The conclusions called for ""the establishment of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience"" and supported the proclamation of the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism.The hearing was followed by a resolution of the European Parliament on European conscience and totalitarianism of  April .


== References ==Externalization is efforts by wealthy, developed countries to prevent asylum seekers and other migrants from reaching their borders, often by enlisting third countries or private entities. Externalization is used by Australia, Canada, the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom. Although less visible than physical barriers at international borders, externalization controls or restrict mobility in ways that are out of sight and far from the country's border. Examples include visa restrictions, sanctions for carriers who transport asylum seekers, and agreements with source and transit countries. Consequences often include increased irregular migration, human smuggling, and border deaths.Extraterritorial Obligations (ETOs) are obligations in relation to the acts and omissions of a state, within or beyond its territory, that have effects on the enjoyment of human rights outside of that state’s territory.An extraterritorial operation in international law is a law enforcement or military operation that takes place outside the territory or jurisdiction of the state whose forces are conducting the operation, generally within the territory of another sovereign state. Under international law, these activities are generally highly restricted, and it is considered a violation of a state's sovereignty if any other state engages in law enforcement or military operations within another state without gaining that state's consent:
The first and foremost restriction imposed by international law on a State is that—failing the existence of a permissive rule to the contrary—it may not exercise its power in any form in the territory of another State.The ""Faces of Freedom"" photo exhibition is a collection of photographs captured by photo-journalist, filmmaker and human rights educator U. Roberto (Robin) Romano, during his travels to India, Nepal and Pakistan. Romano explores the exploitation of child labor in the production of handmade rugs in coordination with multiple international organizations, such as the World Bank, UNICEF, International Labour Organization and others to reduce the number of child laborers in that industry.  The exhibit has been shown in many United States cities since its first exhibit in .  Faces of Freedom has been included in CNN Freedom Projects of modern slavery.Fair Trials is a UK-registered non-governmental organization which works for fair trials according to international standards of justice and the right to a fair trial, identifying where criminal justice is failing, alerting the world to the problems, and resolving these issues through campaigning, advocacy and strategic litigation. It also builds regional legal capacity through targeted training, mentoring and network activities, coordinating a network of criminal justice legal experts and European human rights NGOs called JUSTICIA.Fairview is a secret program under which the National Security Agency cooperates with the American telecommunications company AT&T in order to collect phone, internet and e-mail data mainly of foreign countries' citizens at major cable landing stations and switching stations inside the United States. The FAIRVIEW program started in , one year after the Bell breakup.Family separation is the condition where family members are involuntarily separated from each other, often because of immigration systems, although it can happen for other reasons such as military service or involuntary adoption. Family separation can have a serious impact on mental health. Because family separation interferes with the right to family life, family reunification is a reason for immigration in many countries.""The Forgotten Prisoners"" is an article by Peter Benenson published in The Observer on  May . Citing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights articles  and , it announced a campaign on ""Appeal for Amnesty, "" and called for ""common action"". The article also launched the book Persecution  and its stories of doctor Agostinho Neto, philosopher Constantin Noica, lawyer Antonio Amat and Ashton Jones and Patrick Duncan.Benenson reputedly wrote his article after having learnt that two Portuguese students from Coimbra were imprisoned in Portugal for raising a toast to freedom. The article was reprinted in newspapers across the world and provoked a flood of responses from the readers, marshalling groups in several countries to examine human rights abuses.While, in , the original story still remains to be verified, the appeal marks the beginning of Amnesty International, founded in London the same year following the publication after Benenson enlisted a Conservative, a Liberal and a Labour MP.


== References ==Free migration or open immigration is the position that people should be able to migrate to whatever country they choose with few restrictions.
From a human-rights perspective, free migration may be seen to complement Article  of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights:

Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State.
Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.Freedom from fear is listed as a fundamental human right according to The Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On January , , United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt called it one of the ""Four Freedoms"" at his State of the Union, which was afterwards therefore referred to as the ""Four Freedoms speech"".Freedom in the World is a yearly survey and report by the U.S.-based non-governmental organization Freedom House that measures the degree of civil liberties and political rights in every nation and significant related and disputed territories around the world.Freedom in the World is a yearly survey and report by the U.S.-based non-governmental organization Freedom House that measures the degree of civil liberties and political rights in every nation and significant related and disputed territories around the world.Freedom of speech is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction. The right to freedom of expression has been recognised as a human right in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international human rights law by the United Nations. Many countries have constitutional law that protects free speech. Terms like free speech, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression are used interchangeably in political discourse. However, in a legal sense, the freedom of expression includes any activity of seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.
Article  of the UDHR states that ""everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference"" and ""everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice"". The version of Article  in the ICCPR later amends this by stating that the exercise of these rights carries ""special duties and responsibilities"" and may ""therefore be subject to certain restrictions"" when necessary ""[f]or respect of the rights or reputation of others"" or ""[f]or the protection of national security or of public order (order public), or of public health or morals"".Freedom of speech and expression, therefore, may not be recognized as being absolute, and common limitations or boundaries to freedom of speech relate to libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, hate speech, classified information, copyright violation, trade secrets, food labeling, non-disclosure agreements, the right to privacy, dignity, the right to be forgotten, public security, and perjury. Justifications for such include the harm principle, proposed by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty, which suggests that ""the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others"".The idea of the ""offense principle"" is also used to justify speech limitations, describing the restriction on forms of expression deemed offensive to society, considering factors such as extent, duration, motives of the speaker, and ease with which it could be avoided. With the evolution of the digital age, application of freedom of speech becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise, for example, the Golden Shield Project, an initiative by Chinese government's Ministry of Public Security that filters potentially unfavourable data from foreign countries.
The Human Rights Measurement Initiative measures the right to opinion and expression for countries around the world, using a survey of in-country human rights experts.Freedom of the Press was an annual report on media independence around the world, published between  and  by US-based non-governmental organization Freedom House. It presented measurements of the level of freedom and editorial independence enjoyed by the press in nations and significant disputed territories around the world.The Freedom Online Coalition is a group of  governments that work together to advance Internet freedom, mainly through shaping global norms through Joint Statements, multistakeholder engagement with their Advisory Network and through coordinating diplomatic initiatives and interventions at relevant international forums. The Freedom Online Coalition was launched at a conference of the Dutch Government  in The Hague, the Netherlands in December .Participating countries commit to ""promoting the freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly with respect to the Internet and connection technologies"".  They endorse the principle that the human rights that people have offline should enjoy the same protection online, including freedom of assembly and the right to organize and the right to be protected from ""arbitrary"" intrusions into their privacy. Its work builds on the resolution on ""The Promotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the Internet"" adopted by United Nations Human Rights Council in July . The coalition has also endorsed a set of recommendations for cybersecurity policy making that respects human rights as well as a definition of cybersecurity.
The group has held annual meetings in The Netherlands (), Kenya (), Tunisia (), Estonia (), Mongolia (), Costa Rica (), Germany (), Ghana (), and Finland ().  The group has  member countries ().  In , the Chairship of the Freedom Online Coalition is held by the Government of Canada and the chairing advisors are Bernard Shen, Microsoft and Mallory Knodel, Center for Democracy and Technology (formerly representing ARTICLE ).Gender equality, also known as sexual equality or equality of the sexes, is the state of equal ease of access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender, including economic participation and decision-making; and the state of valuing different behaviors, aspirations and needs equally, regardless of gender.Gender equality is the goal, while gender neutrality and gender equity are practices and ways of thinking that help in achieving the goal. Gender parity, which is used to measure gender balance in a given situation, can aid in achieving gender equality but is not the goal in and of itself. Gender equality is more than just equal representation, it is strongly tied to women's rights, and often requires policy changes. As of , the global movement for gender equality has not incorporated the proposition of genders besides women and men, or gender identities outside of the gender binary.
UNICEF says gender equality ""means that women and men, and girls and boys, enjoy the same rights, resources, opportunities and protections. It does not require that girls and boys, or women and men, be the same, or that they be treated exactly alike.""On a global scale, achieving gender equality also requires eliminating harmful practices against women and girls, including sex trafficking, femicide, wartime sexual violence, gender wage gap, and other oppression tactics. UNFPA stated that, ""despite many international agreements affirming their human rights, women are still much more likely than men to be poor and illiterate. They have less access to property ownership, credit, training and employment. This partly stems from the archaic stereotypes of women being labelled as child-bearers and home makers, rather than the bread winners of the family. They are far less likely than men to be politically active and far more likely to be victims of domestic violence.""As of , gender equality is the fifth of seventeen sustainable development goals (SDG ) of the United Nations. Gender inequality is measured annually by the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Reports.Habeas corpus ( (listen); from Medieval Latin, lit. 'that you have the body') is a recourse in law through which a person can report an unlawful detention or imprisonment to a court and request that the court order the custodian of the person, usually a prison official, to bring the prisoner to court, to determine whether the detention is lawful.The writ of habeas corpus was described in the eighteenth century by William Blackstone as a ""great and efficacious writ in all manner of illegal confinement"". It is a summons with the force of a court order; it is addressed to the custodian (a prison official, for example) and demands that a prisoner be brought before the court, and that the custodian present proof of authority, allowing the court to determine whether the custodian has lawful authority to detain the prisoner. If the custodian is acting beyond their authority, then the prisoner must be released. Any prisoner, or another person acting on their behalf, may petition the court, or a judge, for a writ of habeas corpus. One reason for the writ to be sought by a person other than the prisoner is that the detainee might be held incommunicado. Most civil law jurisdictions provide a similar remedy for those unlawfully detained, but this is not always called habeas corpus. For example, in some Spanish-speaking nations, the equivalent remedy for unlawful imprisonment is the amparo de libertad (""protection of freedom"").
Habeas corpus has certain limitations. Though a writ of right, it is not a writ of course. It is technically only a procedural remedy; it is a guarantee against any detention that is forbidden by law, but it does not necessarily protect other rights, such as the entitlement to a fair trial. So if an imposition such as internment without trial is permitted by the law, then habeas corpus may not be a useful remedy. In some countries, the writ has been temporarily or permanently suspended under the pretext of a war or state of emergency, for example by Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War (see Habeas Corpus Suspension Act ()).The right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus has nonetheless long been celebrated as the most efficient safeguard of the liberty of the subject. The jurist Albert Venn Dicey wrote that the British Habeas Corpus Acts ""declare no principle and define no rights, but they are for practical purposes worth a hundred constitutional articles guaranteeing individual liberty"".The writ of habeas corpus is one of what are called the ""extraordinary"", ""common law"", or ""prerogative writs"", which were historically issued by the English courts in the name of the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are quo warranto, prohibito, mandamus, procedendo, and certiorari. The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority. The official who is the respondent must prove their authority to do or not do something. Failing this, the court must decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. This differs from a motion in a civil process in which the movant must have standing, and bears the burden of proof.Created on July ,  by the Helsinki Summit Meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), now known as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the High Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM) is charged with identifying and seeking early resolution of ethnic tension that might endanger peace, stability or friendly relations between and within the participating states of the OSCE. The HCNM focuses on the OSCE area and will alert the Organisation where a situation has the potential to develop into a conflict. The Organisation consists of  participating States across North America, Europe and Asia. The establishment of the HCNM is generally considered to be a “success story” and a useful instrument of conflict prevention.Homo sacer (Latin for ""the sacred man"" or ""the accursed man"") is a figure of Roman law: a person who is banned and might or might not be killed by anybody, but must not be sacrificed in a religious ritual.The meaning of the term sacer in Ancient Roman religion is not fully congruent with the meaning it took after Christianization, and which was adopted into English as sacred. In early Roman religion sacer denotes anything ""set apart"" from common society and encompasses both the sense of ""hallowed"" and that of ""cursed"". This concept of the sacred contrasts with the Hebrew dichotomy of ""cursed/prohibited"" and ""sacred"", expressed by ""cherem"" and ""qadosh"". The homo sacer could thus also simply mean a person expunged from society and deprived of all rights and all functions in civil religion. Homo sacer is defined in legal terms as someone who can be killed without the killer being regarded as a murderer; and a person who cannot be sacrificed. The sacred human may thus be understood as someone outside the law, or beyond it. With respect to certain monarchs, in certain western legal traditions, the concepts of the sovereign and of the homo sacer have been conflated.The term sacred man could also have been used because the condemned could only rely on protection of gods.The status of homo sacer could fall upon one as a consequence of oath-breaking. An oath in antiquity was essentially a conditional self-cursing, i.e. invoking one or more deities and asking for their punishment in the event of breaking the oath. An oathbreaker was consequently considered the property of the gods whom he had invoked and then deceived. If the oathbreaker was killed, this was understood as the revenge of the gods into whose power he had given himself. Since the oathbreaker was already the property of the oath deity, he could no longer belong to human society, or be consecrated to another deity.
A direct reference to this status is found in the Twelve Tables (.), the laws of the early Roman Republic written in the fifth century BC. The paragraph states that a patron who deceives his clients is to be regarded as sacer.
The idea of the status of an outlaw, a criminal who is declared as unprotected by the law and can consequently be killed by anyone with impunity, persisted throughout the Middle Ages. Medieval perception condemned the entire human race to the intrinsic moral worth of the outlaw, dehumanizing the outlaw literally as a ""wolf"" or ""wolf's-head"" (in an era where hunting of wolves existed strongly, including a commercial element) and is first revoked only by the English Habeas Corpus Act of  which declares that any criminal must be judged by a tribunal before being punished.
Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben takes the concept as the starting point of his main work Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life ().Hong Kong Democracy Council (HKDC) is a Washington, DC-based nonpartisan, non-governmental organization (NGO) with a stated mission of ""protect[ing] Hong Kong’s basic freedoms, autonomy, and the rule of law."" HKDC's research and political work focuses on ""educational outreach, community empowerment, and policy advocacy.""The Hotline for Refugees and Migrants (Hotline) is a human rights organization that utilizes direct service provision, litigation, and advocacy to uphold the rights of refugees, migrant workers, and survivors of human trafficking in Israel. In Hebrew, the organization is known as המוקד לפליטים ולמהגרים (hamoked l'plitim v l'mehagrim).Human rights applied to encryption is a concept of freedom of expression where encryption is a technical resource in the implementation of basic human rights.
With the evolution of the digital age, the application of freedom of speech becomes more controversial as new technologies and restrictions arise, along with governmental and commercial interests. From a human rights perspective, there is a growing awareness that encryption is a core component in realizing a free, open and trustworthy Internet.Human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behavior and are regularly protected as legal rights in municipal and international law. They are commonly understood as inalienable fundamental rights ""to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being"", and which are ""inherent in all human beings"" regardless of their nationality, location, language, religion, ethnic origin or any other status. They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone.Cryptography is a long-standing subject in the field of mathematics and computer science. It can generally be defined as ""the protection of information and computation using mathematical techniques."" In the OECD Guidelines, encryption and cryptography are defined as follows: ""Encryption"" means the transformation of data by the use of cryptography to produce unintelligible data (encrypted data) to ensure its confidentiality.  ""Cryptography"" means the discipline which embodies principles, means, and methods for the transformation of data to hide its information content, establish its authenticity, prevent its undetected modification, prevent its repudiation, and/or prevent its unauthorized use. Encryption and cryptography are often used synonymously, although ""cryptographic"" has a broader technical meaning. For example, a digital signature is ""cryptographic,"" but it is not technically ""encryption"".The human rights aspects related to the availability and use of a technology of particular significance for the field of information and communication are recognised in many places. Freedom of expression is recognized as a human right under article  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recognized in international human rights law in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article  of the UDHR states that ""everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference"" and ""everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice"".Human Rights between the Sexes is an analysis of the human rights of intersex people in  countries. It was written by Dan Christian Ghattas of the Internationalen Vereinigung Intergeschlechtlicher Menschen (the Organisation Intersex International (OII) in Germany) and published in October  by the Heinrich Böll Foundation. The countries studied were Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, New Zealand, Serbia, South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine and Uruguay.A Human Rights City is a municipality that engages with human rights. There are other definitions of human rights city available which are more specific and look at the human rights city from a particular angle. One says that a Human Rights City is a municipality that refers explicitly to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights standards and/or law in their policies, statements, and programs. Another definition states that a Human Rights City is 'a city which is organised around norms and principles of human rights'. This sociological definition emphasises the Human Rights City as a process to which to a varying degree a variety of agents contribute: from activists, experts and academics to international organisations, state governments, and local authorities and officials. Also, this definition does not qualify human rights as international, based on the fact that cities sometimes articulate human rights in their own charters in ways that have no formal or immediate recognition in international law, and may anticipate their appropriation by international bodies and incorporation into international law. The author claims that this definition captures better the different ways in which cities engage with human rights and participate in their co-production, not simply as receivers but also agents of human rights.
Analysts have observed growing numbers of such cities since . Human Rights Cities do not always identify themselves as such but they are often called Human Rights Cities based on the fact that they engage with human rights. Broadly speaking, Human Rights Cities emerged in the late s from the global human rights movement as well as the municipal movement. They reflect efforts of both activist groups and local government officials to improve respect for human rights principles at the local or community level. Because of their focus on local contexts, Human Rights Cities tend to emphasize economic, social, and cultural rights as they affect the lives of residents of cities and other communities and their ability to enjoy civil and political human rights. The human rights city concept is also intertwined with other innovations in human rights practice arisen at the local level, such as the Right to the City.Human rights advocates describe a Human Rights City as “One whose residents and local authorities, through learning about the relevance of human rights to their daily lives (guided by a steering committee), join in ongoing learning, discussions, systematic analysis and critical thinking at the community level, to pursue a creative exchange of ideas and the joint planning of actions to realize their economic, social, political, civil and cultural human rights.” Human rights cities were defined at the  World Human Rights Cities Forum of Gwangju (South Korea) as ""both a local community and a socio-political process in a local context where human rights play a key role as fundamental values and guiding principles."" The European Charter for the Safeguarding of Human Rights in the City and the Global Charter-Agenda for Human Rights in the City also provided a relevant framework for various practices led different cities across the world.Human Rights Day is celebrated annually around the world on  December every year.
The date was chosen to honor the United Nations General Assembly's adoption and proclamation, on  December , of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the first global enunciation of human rights and one of the first major achievements of the new United Nations. The formal establishment of Human Rights Day occurred at the th Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on  December , when the General Assembly declared resolution (V), inviting all member states and any other interested organizations to celebrate the day as they saw fit.The day is normally marked both by high-level political conferences and meetings and by cultural events and exhibitions dealing with human rights issues. Besides, it is traditionally on  December that the five-yearly United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights and Nobel Peace Prize are awarded. Many governmental and non-governmental organizations active in the human rights field also schedule special events to commemorate the day, as do many civil and social-cause organisations.Human rights education (HRE) is the learning process that seeks to build up knowledge, values, and proficiency in the rights that each person is entitled to. This education teaches students to examine their own experiences from a point of view that enables them to integrate these concepts into their values, decision-making, and daily situations. According to Amnesty International, HRE is a way to empower people, training them so their skills and behaviors will promote dignity and equality within their communities, societies, and throughout the world.The ""National Economics and Social Rights Initiative"" stated the importance of Non-Discrimination in HRE. Governments must see to it that it is exercised without bias to race, gender, color, religion, language, national or social origin, political or personal opinion, birth, or any status. All students, parents, and communities possess the right to take part in decisions affecting their respective schools and the right to education.Human rights in cyberspace is a relatively new and uncharted area of law. The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has stated that the freedoms of expression and information under Article () of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) include the freedom to receive and communicate information, ideas and opinions through the Internet.
An important clause is Article () of the ICCPR, which provides that:The exercise of the right provided in paragraph two of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subjected to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;(b) For the protection of national security or of public order, or of public health and morals.The HRC has stated that ""the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online"" (mentioning, in particular, freedom of expression). It is widely regarded that this freedom of information must be balanced with other rights. The question is raised whether people's expectations of human rights are different in cyberspace.Human rights literature is a literary genre that deals with human rights issues, and thus - directly or indirectly - promotes values of human rights. The goal of human rights literature is to combine the literary driving force with the motivation for action, which is a fundamental and integral element of the struggle for protection of human rights. This literary genre is based on the concept of ""Engaged Literature"" that was articulated by the French writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre.
Human rights literature is committed to society and believes that each one of us has moral duty and power to make a social change. It is based on the belief of the enormous power of literature to make a change, and in the responsibility of the author toward readers both on the social aspect and the artistic one.The Human Rights Logo has its origin in the international ""Logo for Human Rights"" initiative, which was started in . Its goal was to create an internationally recognized logo to support the global human rights movement. The winning logo was created by Predrag Stakić from Serbia.Human rights movement refers to a nongovernmental social movement engaged in activism related to the issues of human rights. The foundations of the global human rights movement involve resistance to: colonialism, imperialism, slavery, racism, segregation, patriarchy, and oppression of indigenous peoples.A key principle of the human rights movement is its appeal to universality: the idea that all human beings should struggle in solidarity for a common set of basic conditions that has to be followed by all.Human shields are legally protected persons—either civilians or prisoners of war—who are either coerced or volunteer to deter attacks by occupying the space between a belligerent and a legitimate military target. The use of human shields is forbidden by Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions. It is also a specific intent war crime as codified in the Rome Statute, which was adopted in . The language of the Rome Statute prohibits ""utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas, or military forces immune from military operations.""Historically the law of armed conflict only applied to sovereign states. Non-international conflicts were governed by the domestic law of the State concerned. Under the current terms of the Rome Statute the use of human shields is defined as a war crime only in the context of an international armed conflict.After the end of World War II, non-international armed conflicts have become more commonplace. The Customary International Humanitarian Law guide suggests that rules prohibiting use of civilians as human shields are ""arguably"" customary in non-international armed conflict. The development and application of humanitarian law to modern asymmetric warfare is currently being debated by legal scholars.Humanitarian intervention is the use or threat of military force by a state (or states) across borders with the intent of ending severe and widespread human rights violations in a state which has not given permission for the use of force. Humanitarian interventions are aimed at ending human rights violations of individuals other than the citizens of the intervening state. Humanitarian interventions are only intended to alleviate the worst forms of suffering, which means that peacekeeping, peace-building and development aid do not fall under the definition of a humanitarian intervention.There is not one standard or legal definition of humanitarian intervention; the field of analysis (such as law, ethics or politics) often influences the definition that is chosen. Differences in definition include variations in whether humanitarian intervention is limited to instances where there is an absence of consent from the host state; whether humanitarian intervention is limited to punishment actions; and whether humanitarian intervention is limited to cases where there has been explicit UN Security Council authorization for action. Nonetheless, there is a general consensus on some of its essential characteristics:
Humanitarian intervention involves the threat and use of military forces as a central feature
It is an intervention in the sense that it entails interfering in the internal affairs of a state by sending military forces into the territory or airspace of a sovereign state that has not committed an act of aggression against another state.
The intervention is in response to situations that do not necessarily pose direct threats to states' strategic interests, but instead is motivated by humanitarian objectives.The customary international law concept of humanitarian intervention dates back to Hugo Grotius and the European politics in the th century. However, that customary law has been superseded by the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force in international relations, subject to two exhaustive exceptions: UN Security Council action taken under Chapter VII, and self-defence against an armed attack. The type and frequency of humanitarian interventions have changed drastically since the th century, with a massive increase in humanitarian interventions since the end of the Cold War. Historically, humanitarian interventions were limited to rescuing one's own citizens in other states or to rescue ethnically or religiously similar groups (e.g. Christian countries intervening on behalf of Christians in non-Christian countries). Over the course of the th century (in particular after the end of the Cold War), subjects perceived worthy of humanitarian intervention expanded beyond religiously and ethnically similar groups to encompass all peoples.The subject of humanitarian intervention has remained a compelling foreign policy issue, especially since NATO's intervention in Kosovo in , as it highlights the tension between the principle of state sovereignty – a defining pillar of the UN system and international law – and evolving international norms related to human rights and the use of force. Moreover, it has sparked normative and empirical debates over its legality, the ethics of using military force to respond to human rights violations, when it should occur, who should intervene, and whether it is effective. To its proponents, it marks imperative action in the face of human rights abuses, over the rights of state sovereignty, while to its detractors it is often viewed as a pretext for military intervention often devoid of legal sanction (as indeed a new customary law norm would require sufficient state practice) selectively deployed and achieving only ambiguous ends. Its frequent use following the end of the Cold War suggested to many that a new norm of military humanitarian intervention was emerging in international politics, although some now argue that the / terrorist attacks and the US ""war on terror"" have brought the era of humanitarian intervention to an end.I Am Equal is a photo documentary created by Jason Beckett and fashion photographer Matt Spencer in late . The project has the stated intention of collecting more than , individual photos from  cities around the world and using them to build one of the largest photo mosaics in history. In , the project launched the official world tour in Sacramento, California. The project is estimated to take more than  years to complete and has the ultimate goal of unveiling an ,-square-foot ( m) mosaic in Washington DC containing all the photos collected during the world tour.Identity politics is a political approach wherein people of a particular race, nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, social background, social class, or other identifying factors develop political agendas that are based upon these identities. Identity politics is deeply connected with the idea that some groups in society are oppressed and begins with analysis of that oppression. The term is used primarily to describe political movements in western societies, covering nationalist, multicultural, women's rights, civil rights, and LGBT movements.The term ""identity politics"" dates to the late twentieth century although it had precursors in the writings of individuals such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Frantz Fanon. Many contemporary advocates of identity politics take an intersectional perspective, which accounts for the range of interacting systems of oppression that may affect their lives and come from their various identities. According to many who describe themselves as advocates of identity politics, it centers the lived experiences of those facing systemic oppression; the purpose is to better understand the interplay of racial, economic, sex-based, and gender-based oppression (among others) and to ensure no one group is disproportionately affected by political actions, present and future. Such contemporary applications of identity politics describe people of specific race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, economic class, disability status, education, religion, language, profession, political party, veteran status, recovery status, and geographic location. These identity labels are not mutually exclusive but are in many cases compounded into one when describing hyper-specific groups. An example is that of African-American, homosexual, women, who constitute a particular hyper-specific identity class. Those who take an intersectional perspective, such as Kimberlé Crenshaw, criticise narrower forms of identity politics which overemphasise inter-group differences and ignore intra-group differences and forms of oppression.
Critics of identity politics have seen it as particularist, in contrast to the universalism of liberal perspectives, or argue that it detracts attention from non-identity based structures of oppression and exploitation. A leftist critique of identity politics, such as that of Nancy Fraser, points out that political mobilization based on identitarian affirmation leads to surface redistribution that does not challenge the status quo. Instead, Fraser argued, identitarian deconstruction, rather than affirmation, is more conducive to a leftist politics of economic redistribution. Other critiques, such as that of Kurzwelly, Rapport and Spiegel, point out that identity politics often leads to reproduction and reification of essentialist notions of identity, notions which are inherently erroneous.An immutable characteristic is any sort of physical attribute which is perceived as being unchangeable, entrenched and innate. The term is often used to describe segments of the population which share such attributes and are contrasted from others by those attributes, and is used in human rights law to classify protected groups of people who should be protected from civil or criminal actions which are directed against those immutable characteristics.
For example, a legal debate about sexual orientation concerns whether it is a mutable or immutable characteristic.  If it is immutable, then homosexuality, bisexuality, asexuality, heterosexuality, etc., are all immutable characteristics that naturally occur and cannot be changed.  If it is mutable, then those characteristics can be changed.Impunity means ""exemption from punishment or loss or escape from fines"". In the international law of human rights, it refers to the failure to bring perpetrators of human rights violations to justice and, as such, itself constitutes a denial of the victims' right to justice and redress. Impunity is especially common in countries that lack a tradition of the rule of law, suffer from corruption or that have entrenched systems of patronage, or where the judiciary is weak or members of the security forces are protected by special jurisdictions or immunities. Impunity is sometimes considered a form of denialism of historical crimes.The Index of Freedom in the World is an index of civil liberties published in late  by Canada's Fraser Institute, Germany's Liberales Institut, and the U.S. Cato Institute. The index is the predecessor of the Human Freedom Index, which has been published annually since . The coauthors of both indexes are Ian Vásquez and Tanja Porčnik (née Štumberger).
The index is based on measures of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, individual economic choice, freedom of association, freedom of assembly, violence and crimes, freedom of movement, and women's rights. Other components of the Freedom Index include human trafficking, sexual violence, female genital mutilation, and homicide.The index rates countries on a scale from  (freest) to  (least free). In , the freest countries/regions were New Zealand (.), Switzerland (.), and Hong Kong SAR,  (.). Least free were Syria (.), Venezuela (.), and Yemen (.). The components on which the index is based can be divided into economic freedoms and other personal freedoms. Highest ranking in economic freedoms were Hong Kong (.) and Singapore (.). Highest ranking in personal freedoms were Sweden (.) and the Netherlands (.).  In , United States has dropped to rank  according to The Human Freedom Index.
The Freedom Index does not measure democracy, but it does measure freedom of speech and media, press killings, political imprisonment, etc. According to the report, democracy may be the form of government that best protects freedom, but democracy may both increase and reduce freedom. Nevertheless, democracy strongly correlates with freedom (.), as measured by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index and the Freedom Index.The Freedom Index is included as part of the book Towards a Worldwide Index of Human Freedom, written by  academics and economists from Canada (Fraser Institute), the United States (Cato Institute, Emory University), Germany (Liberales Institut, Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main), and Russia (Institute of Economic Analysis). Among other claims, the report argues that the criminalization of and the war on drugs have restricted many components of freedom.The Indicter, established in Sweden , is an online monthly magazine published in English. It focuses on issues of geopolitics and human rights and its editorial line is liberal to left-wing. Material published by the Indicter has been the subject of international controversy; in  it published an analysis which became an official document at the UN Security Council.
Its mission statement says the Indicter aspires to ""denounce war crimes, human rights abuses, and state assaults on privacy and civil liberties"". The Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter describes the Indicter as a publication associated with the NGO Swedish Doctors for Human Rights (SWEDHR).  However, Sources notes that the monthly magazine's legal publisher is the Swedish company Libertarian Books.Numerous articles published by the Indicter and its predecessor, the Professor's Blog, were reproduced through WikiLeaks' social media between -. However, some of the magazine's analyses have been critically addressed in a number of European mainstream media outlets including Der Spiegel, Le Figaro, France , Liberation, and HuffPost,  in addition to Swedish news sites.
The magazine reached half a million viewers in December , according to Jetpack stats reproduced in the journal (statistics starting April ). The Indicter was founded by Marcello Ferrada de Noli, a social libertarian.The Indigenous Famous Six was created by The Feminist Alliance for International Action for the purpose of advocating for Indigenous women's rights. This collective action by six Indigenous women is similar to the collective effort taken by the ""Famous Five"" that gained Canadian women the right to vote. Collectively the Indigenous Famous Six were active in challenging the sex discrimination in the Indian Act in Canada during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.While the first Indigenous woman to speak out nationally and internationally about the sex discrimination in the Indian Act in the s was Mary Two-Axe Early, the members of the Indigenous Famous Six consisted of six contemporary women who were active in challenging the sex discrimination in the Indian Act either as plaintiffs, international actors and/or proponents at the senate level: Jeannette Corbiere Lavell, Yvonne Bedard, Senator Sandra Lovelace-Nicolas, Sharon McIvor, Dr. Lynn Gehl, and Senator Lillian Dyck.The James E. Rogers College of Law  at the University of Arizona has created an academic center for the study of American Indian and indigenous peoples law, policy, and human rights. The Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy (IPLP) Program furthers the research, training, and advocacy of Indian law and international law of indigenous peoples. Courses and clinical opportunities are offered in areas of law and policy concerning indigenous peoples in the United States and around the world. What makes the Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy (IPLP) Program at the University of Arizona Law (Arizona Law) unique is our approach to legal education in the field of federal Indian law, tribal law and policy, and indigenous peoples human rights. Students are trained in the classroom and in real-world settings by faculty who are leaders both in their academic fields and as practitioners in tribal, national, and international forums. Through clinical studies and direct advocacy under the supervision of the world's most distinguished scholars in the field, students and practitioners provide legal and other forms of assistance to local and international indigenous communities.  
The IPLP Program has been involved in numerous indigenous legal issues around the world. Students and professors in the IPLP Program have assisted Central American Maya villages that have filed lawsuits in the Belize Supreme Court alleging that both the attorney general of Belize and the minister of Natural Resources and Environment had violated their property rights.Faculty and students of the IPLP Program have worked in coordination with other groups representing Carrie Dann and recently deceased Mary Dann, who have struggled against the federal government for decades over Western Shoshone territory, in precedent-setting proceedings before the Organization of American States' Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It culminated with the Inter-American Commission issuing a report in which it condemned the United States for violating the Dann sisters' human rights. In addition, IPLP Program personnel and affiliates have worked with the people of Awas Tingni, a Mayangna (Sumo) indigenous community located on the Atlantic Coast in Nicaragua, for many years with the landmark case decided by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Mayagna (Sumo) Community of Awas Tingni v. Nicaragua. After a lengthy legal battle, the community successfully gained legal recognition of its customary land tenure. Faculty

The Initiative for RECOM is represented in public through the RECOM Reconciliation Network (until , Coalition for RECOM), which is the largest network of non-governmental organizations (more than , members) in the countries of the former SFR Yugoslavia. In , RECOM Reconciliation Network gave up further insistence on the successor states of the SFRY to establish an intergovernmental commission. On that occasion, it took care and responsibility to make a list of victims of the wars caused by the disintegration of SFR Yugoslavia. The coordinator of the RECOM Reconciliation Network is Nataša Kandić.The International Day of the Disappeared, on August  of each year, is a day created to draw attention to the fate of individuals imprisoned at places and under poor conditions unknown to their relatives and/or legal representatives. The impulse for the day came from the Latin American Federation of Associations for Relatives of Detained-Disappeared (Federación Latinoamericana de Asociaciones de Familiares de Detenidos-Desaparecidos, or FEDEFAM), a non-governmental organization founded in  in Costa Rica as an association of local and regional groups actively working against secret imprisonment, forced disappearances and abduction in a number of Latin-American countries.
Work on secret imprisonment is an important part of the activities for a number of international bodies and organizations in the fields of human rights activism and humanitarian aid, including for example Amnesty International (AI), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The International Day of the Disappeared is an opportunity to highlight these institutions' work, increase public awareness, and to call for donations and volunteers.
Of those agencies, the ICRC has additional privileges due to its special status as a non-governmental sovereign entity and its strict policy of neutrality. In some cases, the ICRC is the only institution granted access to specific groups of prisoners, thereby enabling a minimum level of contact and inspection of their treatment. For affected families, messages transmitted by the ICRC are often the only hint about the fate of these prisoners.
Visiting those detained in relation to conflicts and enabling them to restore and maintain contact with their families, is a very important part of the ICRC's mandate. But the definition of the Missing or the Disappeared goes far beyond the victims of enforced disappearance.  It includes all those whose families have lost contact as the result of conflicts, natural disasters or other tragedies.  
These missing may be detained, stranded in foreign countries, hospitalized or dead.  Through its tracing services and working with the  national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world, the ICRC seeks to obtain information about their fate on behalf of their families.  It reminds governments and other groups of their obligations to respect the families' right to know the fate of their loved ones.  It also works with families of the missing to help them address their particular psychological, social legal and financial needs.Imprisonment under secret or uncertain circumstances is a grave violation of some conceptions of human rights as well as, in the case of an armed conflict, of International Humanitarian Law. The General Assembly of the United Nations adopted a Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance as resolution / on December , . It is estimated that secret imprisonment is practiced in about  countries. The OHCHR Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has registered about , cases of people who disappeared under unknown circumstances.
On August , , hundreds of Philippine relatives and supporters of desaparecidos, mostly activists, missing after being abducted or killed by Philippine security forces protested against the government to mark International Day of the Disappeared. Edita Burgos remembered her missing son, Jonas, a member of the Peasants' Movement of the Philippines.On August , , the International Coalition against Enforced Disappearances, which gathers family member organizations and human rights organizations from around the world, joined hands for a global campaign event to promote the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.International human rights law (IHRL) is the body of international law designed to promote human rights on social, regional, and domestic levels. As a form of international law, international human rights law are primarily made up of treaties, agreements between sovereign states intended to have binding legal effect between the parties that have agreed to them; and customary international law. Other international human rights instruments, while not legally binding, contribute to the implementation, understanding and development of international human rights law and have been recognized as a source of political obligation.International human rights law, which governs the conduct of a state towards its people in peacetime is traditionally seen as distinct from international humanitarian law which governs the conduct of a state during armed conflict, although the two branches of law are complementary and in some ways overlap.A more systemic perspective explains that international humanitarian law represents a function of international human rights law; it includes general norms that apply to everyone at all time as well as specialized norms which apply to certain situations such as armed conflict between both state and military occupation (i.e. IHL) or to certain groups of people including refugees (e.g. the  Refugee Convention), children (the Convention on the Rights of the Child), and prisoners of war (the  Third Geneva Convention).The Congressional International Religious Freedom (IRF) Caucus is a bi-partisan group of nearly  members of the United States Congress who address religious persecution for people of any or no faith based on Article  of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.  The IRF Caucus has always addressed religious freedom within the broader context of human rights in the spirit of the International Religious Freedom Act of  (IRFA). The Caucus plays a critical role in raising the profile of numerous religious freedom issues in Congress and with both the Bush and Obama Administrations, and led to the release of many individuals imprisoned for their faith and ensures relief for many suffering under religious persecution.International Women's Year (IWY) was the name given to  by the United Nations. Since that year March  has been celebrated as International Women's Day, and the United Nations Decade for Women, from  to , was also established.An Interpol notice is an international alert circulated by Interpol to communicate information about crimes, criminals, and threats by police in a member state (or an authorised international entity) to their counterparts around the world. The information disseminated via notices concerns individuals wanted for serious crimes, missing persons, unidentified bodies, possible threats, prison escapes, and criminals' modus operandi.There are eight types of notices, seven of which are colour-coded by their function: red, blue, green, yellow, black, orange, and purple. The best-known notice is the red notice which is the ""closest instrument to an international arrest warrant in use today"". An eighth special notice is issued at the request of the United Nations Security Council.
Notices published by Interpol are made either on the organisation's own initiative or are based on requests from national central bureaus (NCBs) of member states or authorised international entities such as the United Nations and the International Criminal Court. All notices are published on Interpol's secure website. Extracts of notices may also be published on Interpol's public website if the requesting entity agrees.
Interpol may only publish a notice that adheres to all the proper legal conditions. For example, a notice will not be published if it violates Interpol's constitution, which forbids the organisation from undertaking activities of a political, military, religious, or racial character. Interpol may refuse to publish a notice that it considers inadvisable or a potential risk.
Notices may be issued in any of the four official languages of Interpol: English, French, Spanish, and Arabic.In human rights, an interstate case occurs when another state party to a human rights treaty brings suit against another state for alleged violations of human rights.Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) or investment court system (ICS) is a system through which countries can be sued by foreign investors for certain state actions affecting foreign direct investment (FDI). This system most often takes the form of international arbitration between a foreign investor and the nation receiving the FDI.ISDS is a unique instrument of public international law, granting private parties (the foreign investors) the right to sue a sovereign nation in a forum other than that nation's domestic courts. Investors are granted this right through international investment agreements between the investor's home nation and the host nation. Such agreements can be found in bilateral investment treaties (BITs), certain international trade treaties (such as the USMCA), or other treaties like the Energy Charter Treaty.
To bring an ISDS claim before an arbitral tribunal, an investor from one country must have an investment in another country, both of these countries must have agreed to ISDS, and the foreign investor must claim that the state has violated one or more of the rights granted to the investor under the treaty.
ISDS claims are often brought under the rules of ICSID (the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes of the World Bank), or one of several other international arbitral tribunals governed by different rules or institutions, such as the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA), the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC), or the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.
The ISDS system has been criticized by many its perceived failures, including investor bias, inconsistent rulings, inaccurate rulings, high damage awards, and high costs. There is widespread agreement that the ISDS system should be reformed. As of May, , multiple reform efforts are underway.Jus inter gentes, is the body of treaties, U.N. conventions, and other international agreements.  Originally a Roman law concept, it later became a major part of public international law. The other major part is jus gentium,  the Law of Nations.  Jus inter gentes, literally, means ""law between the peoples"".This is not the same as jus gentium, argues Francisco Martin and his co-authors in ""International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law"" (), because jus inter gentes includes internationally recognized human rights.The Khartoum process is an inter-regional forum on migration covering the Horn of Africa and Europe. Its members are the African Union Commission (AUC) and the European Commission (EC).Although the partners' stated intention was to ""establish an effective, humanitarian and safe European migration policy"", the Khartoum process has been criticised by scholars, by the United Kingdom's cross-party International Development Committee, and by observers in Sudan, for undermining European human rights commitments. Concerns have focused especially on European Union (EU) funding being used to support the capture, detention, and in some cases torture, of refugees and other migrants by Libyan and Sudanese authorities.The Koliivshchyna (Ukrainian: Коліївщина, Polish: koliszczyzna) was a major haidamaky rebellion that broke out in Right-bank Ukraine in June , caused by money (Dutch ducats coined in Saint Petersburg) sent by Russia to Ukraine to pay for the locals fighting the Bar Confederation, the dissatisfaction of the peasants with the treatment of Eastern Catholics and Orthodox Christians by the Bar Confederation and the threat of serfdom and the opposition to the nobility and the Poles by the Cossacks and  the peasants. The uprising was accompanied by violence against the members and supporters of the Bar Confederation, Poles, Jews and Roman Catholics and especially Uniate clergymen and culminated in the massacre of Uman. The number of victims is estimated from , to ,, because many communities of national minorities (such as Old Believers, Armenians, Moslems and Greeks) completely disappeared in the area of the uprising.Land law is the form of law that deals with the rights to use, alienate, or exclude others from land. In many jurisdictions, these kinds  of property are referred to as real estate or real property, as distinct from personal property. Land use agreements, including renting, are an important intersection of property and contract law. Encumbrance on the land rights of one, such as an easement, may constitute the land rights of another. Mineral rights and water rights are closely linked, and often interrelated concepts.
Land rights are such a basic form of law that they develop even where there is no state to enforce them; for example, the claim clubs of the American West were institutions that arose organically to enforce the system of rules appurtenant to mining. Squatting, the occupation of land without ownership, is a globally ubiquitous phenomenon.Qasim Rashid (born July , ) is a Pakistani-born American author, activist, and attorney. A member of the Democratic Party, Rashid was an unsuccessful candidate for the Virginia State Senate in  and the Democratic nominee for Virginia's st congressional district in the  election.The Lexington Principles on the Rights of Detainees (Lexington Principles) is a body of international due process principles that reflect the prevailing transnational norms in the area of detainee treatment. The Lexington Principles were completed and published on April , . The instrument consists of  principles and countless annotations prepared by the project's law student editorial board. A primary purpose of the drafters of the Lexington Principles was to assist the jurisprudential evolution of American constitutional due process standards after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Boumediene v. Bush. While each Principle is based on international law, all provisions have been drafted to facilitate vertical norm internalization into the domestic legal system of the United States and other common law countries.The following is a list of persons who have attended the Oslo Freedom Forum (OFF) conferences since its start in . The list is categorized first by country of origin, then by profession and year.Martine-Anstett Award, or Martine-Anstett Human Rights Prize, is awarded every year on  April in Paris to the person, man or woman, strongly committed to the defense of human rights.  April is the anniversary of the day Martine Anstett died. Martine Anstett Human Rights Award is also to protect the rights of migrants.This annual prize is worth  Euros.Mass surveillance is the intricate surveillance of an entire or a substantial fraction of a population in order to monitor that group of citizens. The surveillance is often carried out by local and federal governments or governmental organizations, such as organizations like the NSA, but it may also be carried out by corporations (either on behalf of governments or at their own initiative). Depending on each nation's laws and judicial systems, the legality of and the permission required to engage in mass surveillance varies. It is the single most indicative distinguishing trait of totalitarian regimes. It is also often distinguished from targeted surveillance.
Mass surveillance has often been cited as necessary to fight terrorism, prevent crime and social unrest, protect national security, and control the population. At the same time, mass surveillance has equally often been criticized for violating privacy rights, limiting civil and political rights and freedoms, and being illegal under some legal or constitutional systems. Another criticism is that increasing mass surveillance could lead to the development of a surveillance state or an electronic police state where civil liberties are infringed or political dissent is undermined by COINTELPRO-like programs. Such a state could be referred to as a totalitarian state.In , the practice of mass surveillance by world governments was called into question after Edward Snowden's  global surveillance disclosure on the practices by the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States. Reporting based on documents Snowden leaked to various media outlets triggered a debate about civil liberties and the right to privacy in the Digital Age. Mass surveillance is considered a global issue. The Aerospace Corporation of the United States describes a near-future event they call the ""GEOINT Singularity"" in which everything on the surface of the earth will be monitored at all times, analyzed by artificial intelligence systems, and then redistributed and made available to the general public globally in realtime.Lambo Sandjo Pierre Roger ( April  –  March ), better known as Lapiro de Mbanga, was a Cameroonian singer who is noted for his  recording of ""Pas argent no love"" and for being imprisoned in  after criticising Cameroon president Paul Biya in the song ""Constitution constipée"" (""Constipated Constitution"").Medical neutrality refers to a principle of noninterference with medical services in times of armed conflict and civil unrest: physicians must be allowed to care for the sick and wounded, and soldiers must receive care regardless of their political affiliations; all parties must refrain from attacking and misusing medical facilities, transport, and personnel. Concepts comprising the principles of medical neutrality derive from international human rights law, medical ethics and humanitarian law.  Medical neutrality may be thought of as a kind of social contract that obligates societies to protect medical personnel in both times of war and peace, and obligates medical personnel to treat all individuals regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, or political affiliation.  Violations of medical neutrality constitute crimes outlined in the Geneva Conventions.Memorialization generally refers to the process of preserving memories of people or events. It can be a form of address or petition, or a ceremony of remembrance or commemoration.Menstrual hygiene management (MHM) or menstrual health and hygiene (MHH) refers to access to menstrual hygiene products to absorb or collect the flow of blood during menstruation, privacy to change the materials, and access to facilities to dispose of used menstrual management materials. It can also include the ""broader systemic factors that link menstruation with health, well-being, gender equality, education, equity, empowerment, and rights"". Menstrual hygiene management can be particularly challenging for girls and women in developing countries, where clean water and toilet facilities are often inadequate. Menstrual waste is largely ignored in schools in developing countries, despite it being a significant problem. Menstruation can be a barrier to education for many girls, as a lack of effective sanitary products restricts girls' involvement in educational and social activities.The militarization of police (paramilitarization of police in some media) is the use of military equipment and tactics by law enforcement officers. This includes the use of armored personnel carriers (APCs), assault rifles, submachine guns, flashbang grenades, sniper rifles, and SWAT (special weapons and tactics) teams. The militarization of law enforcement is also associated with intelligence agency–style information gathering aimed at the public and political activists and with a more aggressive style of law enforcement. Criminal justice professor Peter Kraska has defined militarization of police as ""the process whereby civilian police increasingly draw from, and pattern themselves around, the tenets of militarism and the military model"".Observers have noted the militarizing of the policing of protests. Since the s, riot police have fired at protesters using guns with rubber bullets or plastic bullets. Tear gas, which was developed by the United States Army for riot control in , is still widely used against protesters. The use of tear gas in warfare is prohibited by various international treaties that most states have signed; however, its law enforcement or military use for domestic or non-combat situations is permitted.
Concerns about the militarization of police have been raised by both ends of the political spectrum in the United States, with both the libertarian Cato Institute and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) voicing criticisms of the practice. The Fraternal Order of Police has spoken out in favor of equipping law enforcement officers with military equipment, claiming that it increases the officers' safety and enables them to protect members of the public and other first responders (e.g., firefighters and emergency medical services personnel). However, a  study showed that police forces which received military equipment were more likely to have violent encounters with the public, regardless of local crime rates. A  study found that militarized police units in the United States were more frequently deployed to communities with large shares of African-Americans, even after controlling for local crime rates.Many countries also have a gendarmerie, which is a military force with law enforcement duties among the civilian population.
France classifies some weapons as ""intermediary force weapons"" such as its LBD  refitted version of the Swiss B&T GL military grenade launcher, which is used in riot police situations or against individual persons in more specific interventions.
While not having the full power of military guns, some weapons are heavier than regular police weaponry and are still lethal. These are often referred to with the ""limited lethality"" appellation.The term 'minority group' has different usages depending on the context. According to it's common usage, a minority group can simply be understood in terms of demographic sizes within a population: i.e. a group in society with the least number of individuals is therefore the 'minority'. However, in terms of sociology, economics, and politics; a demographic which takes up the smallest fraction of the population is not necessarily the 'minority'. In the academic context, 'minority' and 'majority' groups are more appropriately understood in terms of hierarchical power structures. For example, in South Africa during Apartheid, white Europeans held virtually all social, economic, and political power over black Africans. For this reason, black Africans are the 'minority group', despite the fact that they outnumber white Europeans in South Africa. This is why academics more frequently use the term 'minority group' to refer to a category of people who experience relative disadvantage as compared to members of a dominant social group.Minority group membership is typically based on differences in observable characteristics or practices, such as: ethnicity (ethnic minority), race (racial minority), religion (religious minority), sexual orientation (sexual minority), or disability. The framework of intersectionality can be used to recognize that an individual may simultaneously hold membership in multiple minority groups (e.g. both a racial and religious minority). Likewise, individuals may also be part of a minority group in regard to some characteristics, but part of a dominant group in regard to others.The term ""minority group"" often occurs within the discourse of civil rights and collective rights, as members of minority groups are prone to differential treatment in the countries and societies in which they live. Minority group members often face discrimination in multiple areas of social life, including housing, employment, healthcare, and education, among others.  While discrimination may be committed by individuals, it may also occur through structural inequalities, in which rights and opportunities are not equally accessible to all. The language of minority rights is often used to discuss laws designed to protect minority groups from discrimination and afford them equal social status to the dominant group.A miscarriage of justice occurs when a grossly unfair outcome occurs in a criminal or civil proceeding, such as the conviction and punishment of a person for a crime they did not commit. Miscarriages are also known as wrongful convictions. Innocent people have sometimes ended up in prison for years before their conviction has eventually been overturned. They may be exonerated if new evidence comes to light or it is determined that the police or prosecutor committed some kind of misconduct at the original trial. In some jurisdictions this leads to the payment of compensation.Academic studies have found that the main factors contributing to miscarriages of justice are: eyewitness misidentification; faulty forensic analysis; false confessions by vulnerable suspects; perjury and lies stated by witnesses; misconduct by police, prosecutors or judges; and/or ineffective assistance of counsel (e.g., inadequate defense strategies by the defendant's or respondent's legal team).
Some prosecutors' offices undertake conviction integrity reviews to prevent, identify, and correct wrongful convictions.National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR), founded in , now comprises four operational strands, each of which is working to eradicate caste-based discrimination against Dalits in India. It is based in Delhi and has chapters elsewhere in the country. It has stated its aims to be achieving greater visibility for Dalit issues and holding the state, in the form of its criminal justice system, accountable for its alleged failures.The National Rural and Indigenous Women's Association (Asociación Nacional de Mujeres Rurales e Indígenas, ANAMURI) is a non-profit and autonomous Chilean civil organization, which is only open to women. The organization was founded in  in Buin, Chile. Its mission is to organize and promote the development of rural and indigenous Chilean women by stimulating and strengthening their organization.ANAMURI forms part of the Latin American Coordinator of Field Organizations and the International Via Campesina (Coordinadora Latinoamericana de Organizaciones del Campo y la Vía Campesina Internacional). In , ANAMURI had approximately  partners.Network Against Trafficking, Abuse and Labour (NACTAL) is an umbrella organisation of Nigerian non-governmental organizations engaged in advocacy and campaign for children's rights, anti-human trafficking, human rights abuse and child labour with some  member organizations in the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory.Nursing home residents' rights are the legal and moral rights of the residents of a nursing home. Legislation exists in various jurisdictions to protect such rights.  An early example of a statute protecting such rights is Florida statute ., enacted in , and commonly known as the Residents' Rights Act.
Specific rights protected vary greatly by jurisdiction. Types of rights protected include: dignity, medical privacy, pecuniary, dietary and visitation rights. Process rights, such as right of complaint, are also sometimes protected.In international law, odious debt, also known as illegitimate debt, is a legal theory that says that the national debt incurred by a despotic regime should not be enforceable. Such debts are, thus, considered by this doctrine to be personal debts of the regime that incurred them and not debts of the state. In some respects, the concept is analogous to the invalidity of contracts signed under coercion.Despite antecedents dating back to the s and support from diverse fields such as economics, philosophy, political science, history, and law, odious debt is not part of international law; in fact, ""[n]o national or international tribunal has ever cited Odious Debt as grounds for invalidating a sovereign obligation."" Instead, international law holds governments strictly liable for all debt incurred by their predecessors.The following outline is provided as an overview of and introduction to rights:
Rights – normative principles, variously construed as legal, social, or moral freedoms or entitlements.The Paris Principles were defined at the first International Workshop on National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights held in Paris on – October . They were adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission by Resolution / of , and by the UN General Assembly in its Resolution / of . In addition to exchanging views on existing arrangements, the workshop participants drew up a comprehensive series of recommendations on the role, composition, status and also functions of national human rights institutions (NHRIs). These built on standards previously adopted by the  Geneva Seminar on National and Local Institutions
for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights’, which produced the ‘Guidelines on the Structure and Functioning of National and Local Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights’. The  Paris Principles regulate to the status and functioning of national institutions for the protection and promotion of human rights known as National Human Rights Institutions.Personhood or personality is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in philosophy and law and is closely tied with legal and political concepts of citizenship, equality, and liberty. According to law, only a legal person (either a natural or a juridical person) has rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and legal liability.Personhood continues to be a topic of international debate and has been questioned critically during the abolition of human and nonhuman slavery, in debates about abortion and in fetal rights and/or reproductive rights, in animal rights activism, in theology and ontology, in ethical theory, and in debates about corporate personhood and the beginning of human personhood.Processes through which personhood is recognized socially and legally vary cross-culturally, demonstrating that notions of personhood are not universal. Anthropologist Beth Conklin has shown how personhood is tied to social relations among the Wari' people of Rondônia, Brazil. Bruce Knauft's studies of the Gebusi people of Papua New Guinea depict a context in which individuals become persons incrementally, again through social relations. Likewise, Jane C. Goodale has also examined the construction of personhood in Papua New Guinea.The philosophy of human rights attempts to examine the underlying basis of the concept of human rights and critically looks at its content and justification. Several theoretical approaches have been advanced to explain how and why the concept of human rights developed.
One of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds. Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with Hume). Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of Weber). These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in Rawls) – a social contract. The two theories that dominate contemporary human rights discussion are the interest theory and the will theory. Interest theory argues that the principal function of human rights is to protect and promote certain essential human interests, while will theory attempts to establish the validity of human rights based on the unique human capacity for freedom.A presumption of guilt is any presumption within the criminal justice system that a person is guilty of a crime, for example a presumption that a suspect is guilty unless or until proven to be innocent.Such a presumption may legitimately arise from a rule of law or a procedural rule of the court or other adjudicating body which determines how the facts in the case are to be proved, and may be either rebuttable or irrebuttable. An irrebuttable presumption of fact may not be challenged by the defense, and the presumed fact is taken as having been proved.  A rebuttable presumption shifts the burden of proof onto the defense, who must collect and present evidence to prove the suspect's innocence, in order to obtain acquittal. Rebuttable presumptions of fact, arising during the course of a trial as a result of specific factual situations (for example that the accused has taken flight), are common; but an opening presumption of guilt based on the mere fact that the suspect has been charged is considered illegitimate in many countries and contrary to international human rights standards. In the United States, an irrebuttable presumption of guilt is considered to be unconstitutional.
Informal and legally illegitimate presumptions of guilt may also arise from the attitudes or prejudices of those such as judges, lawyers or police officers who administer the system. Such presumptions may result in suspects who are innocent being brought before a court to face criminal charges, with a risk of improperly being found guilty.The presumption of innocence is a legal principle that every person accused of any crime is considered innocent until proven guilty.  Under the presumption of innocence, the legal burden of proof is thus on the prosecution, which must present compelling evidence to the trier of fact (a judge or a jury).  If the prosecution does not prove the charges true, then the person is acquitted of the charges.  The prosecution must in most cases prove that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If reasonable doubt remains, the accused must be acquitted.  The opposite system is a presumption of guilt.
In many countries and under many legal systems, including common law and civil law systems (not to be confused with the other kind of civil law, which deals with non-criminal legal issues), the presumption of innocence is a legal right of the accused in a criminal trial.  It is also an international human right under the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article .Prisoners' rights in international law are found in a number of international treaties. For the most part these treaties came into existence following the two World Wars and the body of law continues to be added to and amended.Privacy (UK: , US: ) is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively.
The domain of privacy partially overlaps with security, which can include the concepts of appropriate use and protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity. The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasions of privacy by the government, corporations, or individuals is part of many countries' privacy laws, and in some cases, constitutions.
The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern concept primarily associated with Western culture, particularly British and North American, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. Now, most cultures recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of personal information from wider society. With the rise of technology, the debate regarding privacy has shifted from a bodily sense to a digital sense. As the world has become digital, there have been conflicts regarding the legal right to privacy and where it is applicable. In most countries, the right to a reasonable expectation to digital privacy has been extended from the original right to privacy, and many countries, notably the US, under its agency, the Federal Trade Commission, and those within the European Union (EU), have passed acts that further protect digital privacy from public and private entities and grant additional rights to users of technology.
With the rise of the Internet, there has been an increase in the prevalence of social bots, causing political polarization and harassment. Online harassment has also spiked, particularly with teenagers, which has consequently resulted in multiple privacy breaches. Selfie culture, the prominence of networks like Facebook and Instagram, location technology, and the use of advertisements and their tracking methods also pose threats to digital privacy.
Through the rise of technology and immensity of the debate regarding privacy, there have been various conceptions of privacy, which include the right to be let alone as defined in ""The Right to Privacy"", the first U.S. publication discussing privacy as a legal right, to the theory of the privacy paradox, which describes the notion that users' online may say they are concerned about their privacy, but in reality, are not. Along with various understandings of privacy, there are actions that reduce privacy, the most recent classification includes processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information, as defined by Daniel J. Solove. Conversely, in order to protect a user's privacy, multiple steps can be taken, specifically through practicing encryption, anonymity, and taking further measures to bolster the security of their data.A privacy policy is a statement or legal document (in privacy law) that discloses some or all of the ways a party gathers, uses, discloses, and manages a customer or client's data. Personal information can be anything that can be used to identify an individual, not limited to the person's name, address, date of birth, marital status, contact information, ID issue, and expiry date, financial records, credit information, medical history, where one travels, and intentions to acquire goods and services. In the case of a business, it is often a statement that declares a party's policy on how it collects, stores, and releases personal information it collects. It informs the client what specific information is collected, and whether it is kept confidential, shared with partners, or sold to other firms or enterprises. Privacy policies typically represent a broader, more generalized treatment, as opposed to data use statements, which tend to be more detailed and specific.
The exact contents of a certain privacy policy will depend upon the applicable law and may need to address requirements across geographical boundaries and legal jurisdictions. Most countries have own legislation and guidelines of who is covered, what information can be collected, and what it can be used for. In general, data protection laws in Europe cover the private sector, as well as the public sector. Their privacy laws apply not only to government operations but also to private enterprises and commercial transactions.California Business and Professions Code, Internet Privacy Requirements (CalOPPA) mandate that websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from California residents must conspicuously post their privacy policy. (See also Online Privacy Protection Act)The public interest is ""the welfare  or well-being of the general public"" and society.Public interest law refers to legal practices undertaken to help poor, marginalized, or under-represented people, or to effect change in social policies in the public interest, on 'not for profit' terms (pro bono publico), often in the fields of civil rights, civil liberties, religious liberty, human rights, women's rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on.In a celebrated  speech, Louis Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that ""able lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people.""In the tradition thus exemplified, a common ethic for public-interest lawyers in a growing number of countries remains ""fighting for the little guy"".R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [] UKHL  was heard by the Lords of Appeal in the House of Lords on  May  before Lord Nicholls, Lord Hoffmann, Lord Rodger, Lord Walker, and Lord Carswell.
This civil action involved two litigants - Annette Carson and Joanne Reynolds, which was on appeal from the Supreme Court and was a UK labour law and Human Rights Act  case on ""Right to property"" under Article  of the First Protocol (Protection of Property) and Article  of the convention (Prohibition of Discrimination. In Reynolds's case, there was also Article  - the right to respect for ""private and family life"" to consider.R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions & Another [] EWHC  (Admin) was heard in the Administration Court of the Queen's Bench Division in the High Court of Justice on  May  before the Honourable Mr. Justice Burnton.Annette Carson was the claimant, the Secretary of State for the Department of Work and Pensions (the UK Government) was the defendant and the Commonwealth of Australia was an intervening party.This was a Human Rights Act  case on the ""right to property"" under Article  of the First Protocol and Prohibition of Discrimination under Article  of the European Convention on Human Rights as reflected in UK law.R (Carson) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and R (Carson & Reynolds) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions were a series of civil action court cases seeking judicial review of the British government's policies under the Human Rights Act . They related to the right to property under Article  of the First Protocol and prohibition of discrimination under Article  of the convention. In Reynolds's case, there was also Article  of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the right to respect for ""private and family life"" to be considered, as well as Article  of the ECHR, the prohibition of torture, and ""inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment"".Regional human rights regimes are relatively independently coherent human rights sub-regimes that are nested within the larger frame work of International human rights practice. Three principal regional human rights instruments can be identified, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights (the Americas) and the European Convention on Human Rights.René Victor Marie Barthes (–) is a colonial administrator, governor general of French West Africa.Reparations are broadly understood as compensation given for an abuse or injury. The colloquial meaning of reparations has changed substantively over the last century. In the early s, reparations were interstate exchanges (see war reparations) that were punitive mechanisms determined by treaty and paid by the surrendering side of conflict, such as the World War I reparations paid by Germany and its allies. Reparations are now understood as not only war damages but also compensation and other measures provided to victims of severe human rights violations by the parties responsible. The right of the victim of an injury to receive reparations and the duty of the part responsible to provide them has been secured by the United Nations.
In transitional justice, reparations are measures taken by the state to redress gross and systematic violations of human rights law or humanitarian law through the administration of some form of compensation or restitution to the victims. Of all the mechanisms of transitional justice, reparations are unique because they directly address the situation of the victims. Reparations, if well designed, acknowledge victims' suffering, offer measures of redress, as well as some form of compensation for the violations suffered. Reparations can be symbolic as well as material. They can be in the form of public acknowledgement of or apology for past violations, indicating state and social commitment to respond to former abuses.
Proponents of reparations assert that in order to be effective, reparations must be employed alongside other transitional justice measures such as prosecutions, truth-seeking, and institutional reform. Such mechanisms ensure that compensatory measures are not empty promises, temporary stopgap measures, or attempts to buy the silence of victims.The right of return is a principle in international law which guarantees everyone's right of voluntary return to, or re-entry to, their country of origin or of citizenship. The right of return is part of the broader human rights concept freedom of movement and is also related to the legal concept of nationality. While many states afford their citizens the right of abode, the right of return is not restricted to citizenship or nationality in the formal sense. It allows stateless persons and for those born outside their country to return for the first time, so long as they have maintained a ""genuine and effective link"".The right is formulated in several modern treaties and conventions, most notably in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the  Fourth Geneva Convention. Legal scholars have argued that one or more of these international human rights instruments have attained the status of customary international law and that the right of return is therefore binding on non-signatories to these conventions.The right of return is often invoked by representatives of refugee groups to assert that they have a right to return to the country from which they were displaced.The right of self-defense (also called, when it applies to the defense of another, alter ego defense, defense of others, defense of a third person) is the right for people to use reasonable or defensive force, for the purpose of defending one's own life (self-defense) or the lives of others, including – in certain circumstances – the use of deadly force.If a defendant uses defensive force because of a threat of deadly or grievous harm by the other person, or a reasonable perception of such harm, the defendant is said to have a ""perfect self-defense"" justification. If defendant uses defensive force because of such a perception, and the perception is not reasonable, the defendant may have an ""imperfect self-defense"" as an excuse.The right to a healthy environment or the right to a sustainable and healthy environment is a human right advocated by human rights organizations and environmental organizations to protect the ecological systems that provide human health. The right was acknowledged by the United Nations Human Rights Council during its th session in October  in HRC/RES// and subsequently by the United Nations General Assembly on July ,  in A/RES//. The right is often the basis for human rights defense by environmental defenders, such as land defenders, water protectors and  indigenous rights activists.
The right is interconnected with other health-focused human rights, such as the right to water and sanitation, right to food and right to health. The right to a healthy environment uses a human rights approach to protect environmental quality; this approach addresses the impact of environmental harm upon individual humans, as opposed to the more traditional approach of environmental regulation which focuses on impacts to other states or the environment itself. Yet another approach to environmental protection is rights of nature which tries to extend the rights enjoyed by humans and corporations to nature as well.The right to an adequate standard of living is a fundamental human right. It is part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that was accepted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December , .
Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of him/herself and of his/her family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his/her control.
Furthermore, it has been written down in article  of the United Nations' International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
The predecessor of this right, the Freedom from Want, is one of the Four Freedoms that American President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke out at his State of the Union of January , . According to Roosevelt it is a right every human being everywhere in the world should have. Roosevelt described his third right as follows:
The third is freedom from want which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants, everywhere in the world.The Right to an effective remedy is the right of a person whose human rights have been violated to legal remedy. Such a remedy must be accessible, binding, capable of bringing perpetrators to justice, provide appropriate reparations, and prevent further violations of the person's rights. The right to an effective remedy guarantees the individual the ability to seek remedy from the state directly rather than through an international process. It is a practical means of protecting human rights on the state level and requires the state to not just protect human rights de jure but also in practice for individual cases. The right to an effective remedy is commonly recognized as a human right in international human rights instruments.The right to an effective remedy is expressed in Article  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article  of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article  of the European Convention on Human Rights, and Article  of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights.The right to be heard (also children's participation) is a child rights principle as defined by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. According to Article  of the convention, children have the right to express their views in all matters affecting them and their views have to be given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. This right applies equally to children's participation in social and political matters as well as in judicial and administrative proceedings. As a general principle, the child's right to be heard reflects the concept of children's ‘agency’, viewing children not only as vulnerable persons in need of special protection, but also as informed decision makers, rights holders and active members of society.The right to be heard from Article  relates closely to other articles under the convention, which together form the so-called ‘participatory rights’ of children and underline the understanding of children as citizens who are rights holders. These articles include:

Article  - the child's right to seek, receive and impart information
Article  - freedom of thought, conscience and religion
Article  - freedom of association.The right to adequate clothing, or the right to clothing, is recognized as a human right in various international human rights instruments; this, together with the right to food and the right to housing, are parts of the right to an adequate standard of living as recognized under Article  of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). The right to clothing is similarly recognized under Article  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).The right to disconnect is a proposed human right regarding the ability of people to disconnect from work and primarily not to engage in work-related electronic communications such as e-mails or messages during non-work hours. The modern working environment has been drastically changed by new communication and information technologies. The boundary between work life and home life has shrunk with the introduction of digital tools into employment. While digital tools bring flexibility and freedom to employees they also can create an absence of limits, leading to excessive interference in the private lives of employees. Several countries, primarily in Europe, have some form of the right to disconnect included in their law, while in some cases it is present in the policy of many large companies. On July , , the Petition  called for introduction of the right to disconnect or as it is called in French “Le droit à la déconnexion” in the Labour Law in Luxembourg.In the regulation of algorithms, particularly artificial intelligence and its subfield of machine learning, a right to explanation (or right to an explanation) is a right to be given an explanation for an output of the algorithm. Such rights primarily refer to individual rights to be given an explanation for decisions that significantly affect an individual, particularly legally or financially. For example, a person who applies for a loan and is denied may ask for an explanation, which could be ""Credit bureau X reports that you declared bankruptcy last year; this is the main factor in considering you too likely to default, and thus we will not give you the loan you applied for.""
Some such legal rights already exist, while the scope of a general ""right to explanation"" is a matter of ongoing debate. There have been arguments made that a ""social right to explanation"" is a crucial foundation for an information society, particularly as the institutions of that society will need to use digital technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning. In other words, that the related automated decision making systems that use explainability would be more trustworthy and transparent. Without this right, which could be constituted both legally and through professional standards, the public will be left without much recourse to challenge the decisions of automated systems. One of the emerging problems is how to communicate an explanation to a user, should it be through text, a high-level visual diagram, video or some other medium, and how can an explainable system scope the explanation in a reasonable way?The right to family life is the right of all individuals to have their established family life respected, and to have and maintain family relationships. This right is recognised in a variety of international human rights instruments, including Article  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article  of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and Article  of the European Convention on Human Rights.The right to personal identity is recognised in international law through a range of declarations and conventions. From as early as birth, an individual's identity is formed and preserved by registration or being bestowed with a name. However, personal identity becomes more complex as an individual develops a conscience. But human rights exist to defend and protect individuality, as quoted by Law Professor Jill Marshall ""Human rights law exist to ensure that individual lifestyle choices are protected from majoritarian or populist infringement."" Despite the complexity of personal identity, it is preserved and encouraged through privacy, personality rights and the right to self-expression.The right to petition government for redress of grievances is the right to make a complaint to, or seek the assistance of, one's government, without fear of punishment or reprisals.
The right can be traced back to the Bill of Rights , the Petition of Right (), and Magna Carta ().In Europe, Article  of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ensures the right to petition to the European Parliament.  Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany guarantees the right of petition to ""competent authorities and to the legislature"".  The right to petition in the United States is granted by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution ().The right to privacy is an element of various legal traditions that intends to restrain governmental and private actions that threaten the privacy of individuals. Over  national constitutions mention the right to privacy. On  December , the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), originally written to guarantee individual rights of everyone everywhere; while right to privacy does not appear in the document, many interpret this through Article , which states: ""No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.""Since the global surveillance disclosures of , initiated by ex-NSA employee Edward Snowden, the right to privacy has been a subject of international debate. Government agencies, such as the NSA, FBI, CIA, R&AW and GCHQ, have engaged in mass, global surveillance. Some current debates around the right to privacy include whether privacy can co-exist with the current capabilities of intelligence agencies to access and analyze many details of an individual's life; whether or not the right to privacy is forfeited as part of the social contract to bolster defense against supposed terrorist threats; and whether threats of terrorism are a valid excuse to spy on the general population. Private sector actors can also threaten the right to privacy – particularly technology companies, such as Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo that use and collect personal data. These concerns have been strengthened by scandals, including the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal, which focused on psychographic company Cambridge Analytica which used personal data from Facebook to influence large groups of people.The right to protest may be a manifestation of the right to freedom of assembly, the right to freedom of association, and the right to freedom of speech. Additionally, protest and restrictions on protest have lasted as long as governments have.The right to resist is a nearly universally acknowledged human right, although its scope and content are controversial. The right to resist, depending on how it is defined, can take the form of civil disobedience or armed resistance against a tyrannical government or foreign occupation; whether it also extends to non-tyrannical governments is disputed. Although Hersch Lauterpacht, one of the most distinguished jurists, called the right to resist the supreme human right, this right's position in international human rights law is tenuous and rarely discussed. Forty-two countries explicitly recognize a constitutional right to resist, as does the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.The right to sexuality incorporates the right to express one's sexuality and to be free from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Specifically, it relates to the human rights of people of diverse sexual orientations, including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, and the protection of those rights, although it is equally applicable to heterosexuality. The right to sexuality and freedom from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is based on the universality of human rights and the inalienable nature of rights belonging to every person by virtue of being human.
No right to sexuality exists explicitly in international human rights law; rather, it is found in a number of international human rights instruments including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.Right to truth is the right, in the case of grave violations of human rights, for the victims and their families or societies to have access to the truth of what happened. The right to truth is closely related to, but distinct from, the state obligation to investigate and prosecute serious state violations of human rights. Right to truth is a form of victims' rights; it is especially relevant to transitional justice in dealing with past abuses of human rights. In , Yasmin Naqvi concluded that the right to truth ""stands somewhere on the threshold of a legal norm and a narrative device … somewhere above a good argument and somewhere below a clear legal rule"".Rights of Man (), a book by Thomas Paine, including  articles, posits that popular political revolution is permissible when a government does not safeguard the natural rights of its people. Using these points as a base it defends the French Revolution against Edmund Burke's attack in Reflections on the Revolution in France ().It was published in two parts in March  and February .Ritual servitude is a practice in Ghana, Togo, and Benin where traditional religious shrines (popularly called fetish shrines in Ghana) take human beings, usually young virgin girls, in payment for services or in religious atonement for alleged misdeeds of a family member. In Ghana and in Togo, it is practiced by the Ewe people in the Volta region; in Benin, it is practiced by the Fon.These shrine slaves serve the priests, elders, and owners of a traditional religious shrine without remuneration and without their consent, although the consent of the family or clan may be involved.  Those who practice ritual servitude usually feel that the girl is serving the god or gods of the shrine and is married to the gods of the shrine.If a girl runs away or dies, she must be replaced by another girl from the family. Some girls in ritual servitude are the third or fourth girl in their family suffering for the same crime, sometimes for something as minor as the loss of trivial property.
This form of slavery is still practiced in the Volta Region in Ghana, in spite of being outlawed in , and despite carrying a minimum three-year prison sentence for conviction. Among the Ewes who practice the ritual in Ghana, variations of the practice are also called trokosi, fiashidi, and woryokwe, with ""trokosi"" being the most common of those terms. In Togo and Benin it is called voodoosi or vudusi. Victims are commonly known in Ghana as fetish slaves because the gods of traditional African religions are popularly referred to as fetishes and the priests who serve them as fetish priests.Daniel Rothenberg  
is a  Professor of Practice at the School of Politics and Global Studies and co-director with Peter Bergen of the Center on the Future of War at Arizona State University. He is also a senior fellow at  New America.Rothenberg studies terrorism, human rights and transitional justice
and has worked with  human rights projects in Afghanistan, Iraq, Central Africa and Latin America. He has helped to collect and analyze first-person narratives from thousands of people affected by war and violence, including torture and rape. Rothenberg examines the lived experience of moral injury, using this as a framework for addressing the ethical and emotional impacts of intense and systematic political violence on both individuals and society.Rothenberg was instrumental in developing The Chicago principles on post-conflict justice (). He has also published With these hands : the hidden world of migrant farmworkers today (), Testimonies : Iraq History Project (), Memory of silence : the Guatemalan Truth Commission Report () and Drone wars : transforming conflict, law, and policy ().The Rule of Law in Armed Conflicts Project (RULAC Project) is an initiative of the Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights to support the application and implementation of the international law of armed conflict.Safety of journalists is the ability for journalists and media professionals to receive, produce and share information without facing physical or moral threats.
Journalists can face violence and intimidation for exercising their fundamental right to freedom of expression. The range of threats they are confronted to include murder, kidnapping, hostage-taking, offline and online harassment, intimidation, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and torture. Women journalists also face specific dangers and are especially vulnerable to sexual assault, ""whether in the form of a targeted sexual violation, often in reprisal for their work; mob-related sexual violence aimed against journalists covering public events; or the sexual abuse of journalists in detention or captivity. Many of these crimes are not reported as a result of powerful cultural and professional stigmas.""Increasingly, journalists, and particularly women journalists, are facing abuse and harassment online, such as hate speech, cyber-bullying, cyber-stalking, doxing, trolling, public shaming and intimidation and threats.Self-executing rights in international human rights law are formulated in such a way that one can deduce that it was the purpose to create international laws that citizens can invoke directly in their national courts. Self-executing rights, or directly applicable rights, are rights that from the viewpoint of international law do not require transformation into national law. The rights are binding as such and judges can apply the international law as if it were national law. From the viewpoint of national law, it may be required that all international law be incorporated into national law before becoming valid. This depends on the national legal tradition.
To decide whether or not a rule is self-executing, one must only look at the rule in question, and national traditions do not count. A rule that says that states should guarantee freedom of expression to its citizens is self-executing. A rule that states should take all the necessary measures to create enough employment is not. Non-self-executing rules of international law impose the obligation on states only to take measures and to create or alter legislation. Citizens or national judges cannot invoke those rules (and demand employment, as in the previous example) in a national court. That means that international law that is not self-executing must be transformed into national law to take effect.
The priority of international law remains a fact whether or not the law is self-executing. A state cannot invoke its national law as a reason not to respect its international obligations. In case of non-self-executing rules, it is obliged to change its national law or to take certain measures. It violates international law if it does not do so. In this case, a national judge can only decide that their state should modify national law or take certain measures. They cannot invalidate national law that contradicts non-self-executing international law. They cannot declare national law null and void unless it contradicts self-executing international rights.
Most human rights contained in the main human rights treaties are self-executing and can be invoked by individuals in a national courtroom, but that is more often the case for civil rights than for economic and social rights.SEXINT is the practice of monitoring and/or characterizing/indexing the pornographic preferences of internet users in an effort to later use the information for blackmail. The term is a portmanteau of sexual intelligence retrieved on an intelligence service target and was first used by Jennifer Granick, Director of Civil Liberties at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society.Social dangerousness is a category of anti-social behaviour on the basis of detectors of dangerousness that enable the judicial authorities to justify the need for a particular control by the police authorities.
These measures differ from country to country: in Italy they are called preventive measures, which are derived from a comprehensive analysis that involves both the tendency to commit crimes and the sphere of the moral conduct of an individual. In United Kingdom they were foreseen by Anti-social Behaviour Act  as injunctions; in United States many States apply civil confinement to some antisocial behaviour.On the opposite side, some governments links this analysis directly to prison terms, not complying to nulla poena sine lege principle.The social protection floor (SPF) is the first level of  protection in a national social protection system. It is a basic set of social rights derived from human right treaties, including access to essential services (such as health, education, housing, water and sanitation, and others, as defined nationally) and social transfers, in cash or in kind, to guarantee economic security, food security, adequate nutrition and access to essential services.
As a result of the extreme inequality, social security schemes have been developed and implemented, through private and public initiatives, since the s in Europe and subsequently in other parts of the world. However, the problem of poverty persists. According to the World Bank, over a billion people, or roughly one in six, live in extreme poverty (defined as a daily income not exceeding US$) and . billion people live in poverty (daily income not over US$).
To remedy this situation and promote socio-economic development, the United Nations Chief Executives Board for Coordination (UNCEB) coined the concept of the SPF. This framework aims to place governments as the central responsible actor for the promotion of four essential and universal guarantees, which would set the ground for a more comprehensive social protection system.Social role valorization (SRV) is a method for improving the lives of people who are of low status in society.  (In countries of the British commonwealth, the third word in the term is usually spelled valorisation, but the abbreviation is the same.)  
SRV is applicable to people who for any reason are disadvantaged, discriminated against, marginalized, and otherwise consigned to low status in their society.  This includes those who are poor, of a devalued or despised racial, ethnic, religious, or political group, with any kind of bodily or mental impairment, who are elderly where youth is highly valued, who have few or unwanted skills, who are imprisoned, are illegal and unwanted immigrants, are seriously, chronically, or terminally ill, are disordered or unorthodox in their sexual identity and conduct, or otherwise violate important societal values.  The great majority of members of these classes receive either formal or informal services, provided by families, schools, hospitals, welfare agencies, etc.  SRV is relevant to any kind of human service, in the fields of education, rehabilitation, psychology, social work, medicine, imprisonment/corrections, and so on.
SRV was formulated in  by Wolf Wolfensberger.  He developed SRV as his successor to the earlier Principle of Normalization In Human Services, which originated in Scandinavia in the early s (Nirje, ) and which he then promulgated throughout North America, as well as in England, France, and Australasia.
The International SRV Association was formed in  to promote Social Role Valorization (SRV) development, education, assessment, and leadership to assist people and organizations to implement SRV concepts so that vulnerable people may have access to the good things in life.In criminal law, the right to a speedy trial is a human right under which it is asserted that a government prosecutor may not delay the trial of a criminal suspect arbitrarily and indefinitely. Otherwise, the power to impose such delays would effectively allow prosecutors to send anyone to jail for an arbitrary length of time without trial.
Although it is important for the protection of speedy trial rights for there to be a court in which a defendant may complain about the unreasonable delay of the trial, it is also important that nations implement structures that avoid the delay.Sportswashing is a term used to describe the practice of individuals, groups, corporations, or governments using sports to improve reputations tarnished by wrongdoing. Sportswashing can be accomplished through hosting sporting events, purchasing or sponsoring sporting teams, or participating in a sport. At the international level, it is believed that sportswashing has been used to direct attention away from poor human rights records and corruption scandals.  At the individual and corporate levels, it is believed that sportswashing has been used to cover up vices, crimes, and scandals. Sportswashing is an example of reputation laundering.The State of World Liberty Index was a ranking of countries according to the degree of economic and personal freedoms that their citizens enjoy. It was a compilation of several similar indices created by other organizations. The index's original author Nick Wilson defined freedom as ""the ability for the individual to live their lives as they choose, as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others to do the same.""
Only one report (the  State of World Liberty Index, released  August ) was produced by the State of World Liberty Project and the original website is now defunct.  However, Patrick Rhamey, professor in the Department of International Studies at the Virginia Military Institute, has updated the rankings through  using the same concept, with some adjustments to the original method.The index has been cited by human rights organisations, governments, pro-democracy groups, news organisations, and others.Sustainable Development Goal  (SDG  or Global Goal ) is about ""peace, justice and strong institutions."" One of the  Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in , the official wording is: ""Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels"". The Goal has  targets to be achieved by . Progress towards targets will be measured by  indicators.
The goal has ten ""outcome targets"": Reduce violence; protect children from abuse, exploitation, trafficking and violence; promote the rule of law and ensure equal access to justice; combat organized crime and illicit financial and arms flows, substantially reduce corruption and bribery; develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions; ensure responsive, inclusive and representative decision-making; strengthen the participation in global governance; provide universal legal identity; ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms. There are also two ""means of achieving targets"": Strengthen national institutions to prevent violence and combat crime and terrorism; promote and enforce non-discriminatory laws and policies.
Reducing violent crime, sex trafficking, forced labor, and child abuse are clear global goals. The International Community values peace and justice; they call for stronger judicial systems that will enforce laws and work toward a more peaceful and just society. All women need to be able to turn to fair and effective institution to access Justice and important services. We cannot hope for sustainable development without peace and stability in any country.Targeted surveillance (or targeted interception) is a form of surveillance, such as wiretapping, that is directed towards specific persons of interest, and is distinguishable from mass surveillance (or bulk interception). Both untargeted and targeted surveillance is routinely accused of treating innocent people as suspects in ways that are unfair, of violating human rights, international treaties and conventions as well as national laws, and of failing to pursue security effectively.A  report to the UN General Assembly by the United Nations' top official for counter-terrorism and human rights condemned mass electronic surveillance as a clear violation of core privacy rights guaranteed by multiple treaties and conventions. The report also makes a distinction between ""targeted surveillance"" - which ""depend[s] upon the existence of prior suspicion of the targeted individual or organization"" — and ""mass surveillance"", by which ""states with high levels of Internet penetration can [...] gain access to the telephone and e-mail content of an effectively unlimited number of users and maintain an overview of Internet activity associated with particular websites"".The United Kingdom's House of Lords also distinguishes between these two broad types of surveillance:

Mass surveillance is also known as “passive” or “undirected” surveillance. [...] It is not targeted on any particular individual but gathers images and information for possible future use. CCTV and databases are examples of mass surveillance.
Targeted surveillance is surveillance directed at particular individuals and can involve the use of specific powers by authorised public agencies. Targeted surveillance can be carried out overtly or covertly, and can involve human agents. Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act  (RIPA), targeted covert surveillance is “directed” if it is carried out for a specific investigation or operation. By comparison, if it is carried out on designated premises or on a vehicle, it is “intrusive” surveillance. Targeting methods include the interception of communications, the use of communications “traffic” data, visual surveillance devices, and devices that sense movement, objects or persons.
Only targeted interception of traffic and location data in order to combat serious crime, including terrorism, is justified, according to a decision by the European Court of Justice.The Global Campaign for Equal Nationality Rights is a campaign mobilizes international action to end gender discrimination in nationality laws through local and international advocacy, activism, research, capacity building and knowledge sharing.The Global Campaign for Equal Nationality Rights works on amending nationality laws in the + countries that prevent women from conferring their nationality to non-national spouses; and to reform nationality laws in the  countries which deny mothers their right to confer their nationality to their children, on equal basis with fathers.The right to be forgotten (RTBF) is the right to have private information about a person be removed from Internet searches and other directories under some circumstances. The concept has been discussed and put into practice in several jurisdictions, including Argentina, the European Union (EU), and the Philippines. The issue has arisen from desires of individuals to ""determine the development of their life in an autonomous way, without being perpetually or periodically stigmatized as a consequence of a specific action performed in the past."":  There has been controversy about the practicality of establishing a right to be forgotten (in respect to access of information) as an international human right. This is partly due to the vagueness of current rulings attempting to implement such a right. Furthermore, there are concerns about its impact on the right to freedom of expression, its interaction with the right to privacy, and whether creating a right to be forgotten would decrease the quality of the Internet through censorship and the rewriting of history. Those in favor of the right to be forgotten cite its necessity due to issues such as revenge porn sites appearing in search engine listings for a person's name, as well as instances of these results referencing petty crimes individuals may have committed in the past. The central concern lies in the potentially undue influence that such results may exert upon a person's online reputation almost indefinitely if not removed.The right to be forgotten ""reflects the claim of an individual to have certain data deleted so that third persons can no longer trace them."":   It has been defined as ""the right to silence on past events in life that are no longer occurring."" The right to be forgotten leads to allowing individuals to have information, videos, or photographs about themselves deleted from certain Internet records so that they cannot be found by search engines.
As of  there are few protections against the harm that incidents such as revenge porn sharing, or pictures uploaded due to poor judgement.The right to be forgotten is distinct from the right to privacy. The right to privacy constitutes information that is not publicly known, whereas the right to be forgotten involves removing information that was publicly known at a certain time and not allowing third parties to access the information.:  Limitations of application in a jurisdiction include the inability to require removal of information held by companies outside the jurisdiction. There is no global framework to allow individuals control over their online image. However, Professor Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, an expert from Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, said that Google cannot escape compliance with the law of France implementing the decision of the European Court of Justice in  on the right to be forgotten. Mayer-Schönberger said nations, including the US, had long maintained that their local laws have ""extra-territorial effects"".The mandate of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Toxics and Human Rights was established in  by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.Transgender asylum seekers are transgender persons seeking refuge in another country due to stigmatization or persecution in their home countries. They may be fleeing from state-sponsored discrimination or from social isolation. Transgender people face challenges in the asylum process not experienced by others.Not all armed forces have policies explicitly permitting LGBT personnel. Generally speaking, Western European militaries show a greater tendency toward inclusion of LGBT individuals. As of January ,  countries allow transgender military personnel to serve openly: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Cuba and Thailand reportedly allowed transgender service in a limited capacity. In , the Netherlands was the first country to allow transgender military personnel. The United States has allowed transgender personnel to serve in the military under varying conditions since Joe Biden's signing of an executive order.Transitional justice is a process which responds to massive human rights violations through judicial redress, political reforms in a region or country, and other measures in order to prevent the recurrence of human rights abuse. Transitional justice consists of judicial and non-judicial measures implemented in order to redress legacies of human rights abuses.  Such measures ""include criminal prosecutions, truth commissions, reparations programs, and various kinds of institutional reforms"". Transitional justice is instituted at a point of political transition classically from war to positive peace, or more broadly from violence and repression to societal stability (though some times it is done years later) and it is informed by a society’s desire to rebuild social trust, reestablish what is right from what is wrong, repair a fractured justice system, and build a democratic system of governance. The core value of transitional justice is the very notion of justice—which does not necessarily mean criminal justice. This notion and the political transformation, such as regime change or transition from conflict are thus linked to a more peaceful, certain, and democratic future.
Transitional justice in the modern era has received greater attention from both academics and policymakers. It is also widely discussed in political and legal circles, especially in transitional societies. During political transitions from authoritarian or dictatorial regimes or from civil conflicts to democracy, transitional justice has often provided opportunities for such societies to address past human rights abuses, mass atrocities, or other forms of severe trauma in order to increase the probability of a transition into a more democratic, just, peaceful future.In international law, a treaty body (or treaty-based body) is an internationally established body of independent experts that monitor how States party to a particular international legal instrument are implementing their obligations under it.Turner v. Safley,  U.S.  (), was a U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the constitutionality of two Missouri prison regulations. One of the prisoners' claims related to the fundamental right to marry, and the other related to freedom of speech (in sending/receiving letters). The court held that a regulation preventing inmates from marrying without permission violated their constitutional right to marry because it was not logically related to a legitimate penological concern, but a prohibition on inmate-to-inmate correspondence was justified by prison security needs.The case has been cited as precedent, establishing the ""Turner Test"" for constitutional challenges to prison regulations. According to the test, a prison regulation is constitutional if it satisfies four factors:

There is a rational connection to a legitimate government interest;
There are alternative means for prisoners to exercise their right(s);
Accommodation of the right(s) would have excessive ""ripple effects""; and
There are no ""ready alternatives.""This test has been used for decades by US courts, but it has also been criticized by legal scholars for being too deferential to prison administrators.UN General Assembly Resolution /, the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law, is a United Nations Resolution about the rights of victims of international crimes. It was adopted by the General Assembly on  December  in its th session. According to the preamble, the purpose of the Resolution is to assist victims and their representatives to remedial relief and to guide and encourage States in the implementation of public policies on reparations.
The principles were drafted by Dutch jurist Theo van Boven, who served as the UN's Special Rapporteur on the Right to Reparation to Victims of Gross Violations of Human Rights from  to , and were finalised after over  years of research. They have since been adopted by UN Member States. They are non-binding, however it has been recommended by the General Assembly that States take the Basic Principles and Guidelines into account.
The Resolution consists of  principles outlining the obligation of all UN member states to respect and implement international human rights law and international humanitarian law. It is the first codification of the rights of victims of human rights violations to reparation and remedies, and to access justice within domestic legal systems.United Nations General Assembly Resolution A was adopted on December , , to ratify the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The resolution was adopted by a majority of  countries from among the  members of the United Nations at that time; however  abstained and the Republic of Honduras and the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen did not vote.Special rapporteur (or Independent Expert) are titles given to independent human rights expert whose expertise is called called upon by the United Nations to report or advise on human rights from a thematic or country-specific perspective. Depending on the specific mandate, there can also be Working Groups composed of an independent expert from each of the five UN regional groupings (Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and the Western group). Their work falls within the scope of ""special procedure"" mechanisms under the United Nations Human Rights Council and their contributions can advance human rights through a variety of activities, including, but not limited to improving access to redress, policy reform, mainstreaming human rights, raising human rights awareness, and acting to prevent or cease rights violations. 
The mandate by the United Nations has been to ""examine, monitor, advise, and publicly report"" on human rights problems through ""activities undertaken by special procedures, including responding to individual complaints, psychological operations and manipulation via the controlled media and academia, conducting studies, providing advice on technical cooperation at the country level, and engaging in general promotional activities.""The Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief was established in  by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.The post of Special Rapporteur on Minorities has been created as minorities in all regions of the world are exposed to serious threats, discrimination and racism and are often excluded from participation in economic, political and social life. It shall provide for the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Members of National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, taking into account existing international norms and national minority laws.The Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, formally the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since  is a Special Rapporteur who works for the United Nations and reports on the human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territories. The mandate was established in  by the former Commission on Human Rights.Universal jurisdiction is a legal principle that allows states or international organizations to claim criminal jurisdiction over an accused person regardless of where the alleged crime was committed, and regardless of the accused's nationality, country of residence, or any other relation to the prosecuting entity. Crimes prosecuted under universal jurisdiction are considered crimes against all, too serious to tolerate jurisdictional arbitrage. 
The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that some international norms are erga omnes, or owed to the entire world community, as well as to the concept of jus cogens – that certain international law obligations are binding on all states.According to Amnesty International, a proponent of universal jurisdiction, certain crimes pose so serious a threat to the international community as a whole that states have a logical and moral duty to prosecute an individual responsible; therefore, no place should be a safe haven for those who have committed genocide, crimes against humanity, extrajudicial executions, war crimes, torture, or forced disappearances.Opponents such as Henry Kissinger, who himself was called to give testimony about the US Government's Operation Condor in a Spanish court, argue that universal jurisdiction is a breach of each state's sovereignty: all states being equal in sovereignty, as affirmed by the United Nations Charter, ""[w]idespread agreement that human rights violations and crimes against humanity must be prosecuted has hindered active consideration of the proper role of international courts. Universal jurisdiction risks creating universal tyranny – that of judges."" According to Kissinger, as a logistical matter, since any number of states could set up such universal jurisdiction tribunals, the process could quickly degenerate into politically driven show trials to attempt to place a quasi-judicial stamp on a state's enemies or opponents.
The United Nations Security Council Resolution , adopted by the United Nations Security Council on  April , ""Reaffirm[ed] the provisions of paragraphs  and  of the  World Summit Outcome Document regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity"" and commits the Security Council to action to protect civilians in armed conflict.The Way of Human Rights (German: Straße der Menschenrechte) is a monumental outdoor sculpture in Nuremberg, Germany.  It was opened on  October .  It is sited on the street between the new and old buildings of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, connecting Kornmarkt street and the medieval city wall.
In , a twelve-person jury from the Germanisches Nationalmuseum held a design competition to decide on the artistic design of the Kartäusergasse street in Nuremberg.  
The winner was a proposal by Israeli artist Dani Karavan consisting of a gate,  round pillars made of white concrete, two pillars buried in the ground showing only a round plate, and one columnar oak, for a total of  pillars.  
Engraved in each pillar is one article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in German and another language.  The pillars are  metres in height,  cm in diameter, and spaced regularly at  metres along an axis. The north gate mirrors the medieval city gate located at the south end of the street.
The site of project has a layered history, including the remnants of a monastery, the medieval city wall, buildings designed by Sep Ruf in the s and s, and a glass-enclosed entrance designed by the firm ME DI UM in .
This sculpture is part of Nuremberg's efforts to shake off its Nazi-era reputation as the ""City of the Party Rallies"" and reinvent itself as a ""City of Peace and Human Rights"".In , Nuremberg was honored for this attempt at transformation with the UNESCO Prize for Human Rights Education, the Way of Human Rights being specifically cited.  The monument is intended as both a repudiation of past crimes and a permanent reminder that human rights are still regularly violated.  Nuremberg's prize for human rights, the Nuremberg International Human Rights Award, is awarded on the site every two years.We Have A Dream: Global Summit Against Discrimination and Persecution was an international summit organized by the Geneva-based non-governmental organization UN Watch, and attended by an international collection of non-governmental organizations to discuss issues of discrimination and persecution, particularly those of racism, sexism, homophobia, and discrimination against minorities. It occurred over two days, September  and  of , across the street from a United Nations conference referred to as Durban III.The summit was created in response to the United Nations' inclusion of countries that commit particularly atrocious human rights abuses, especially in the Human Rights Council, such as China, Syria, Sudan, Zimbabwe, North Korea, and Iran. This claim has been supported by the Human Rights Foundation, a partner of the summit, whose President, Thor Halvorssen, refers to Durban III as “the last act in a tragicomedy” that underscores the UN's complacency with “despotic regimes which speak pretty words about human rights while they kill, torture, or jail their opponents”.Wolf ticket is a literal translation of the Russian language phrase волчий билет (volchiy bilet), a colloquial expression to denote a version of a document with restrictive clauses in comparison to the full document. Figuratively, the phrase remains in use in many of the countries of the former communist bloc, usually to denote any kind of document that negatively affects one's career.
Originally the phrase was used in Imperial Russia to denote a document issued instead of the internal passport to persons who were given a half-year postponement of katorga or exile for settling personal affairs. Later, it denoted a limited certificate for completion of studies. Unlike a regular diploma, it merely stated that the studies were completed, but the student was not allowed to take exams for reasons of poor study or improper behavior.
A wolf ticket was a serious impediment to one's career. Still later this phrase was applied to a document issued in place of an internal passport to persons released from imprisonment (""certificate of release""). Usually this kind of document restricted the rights of a citizen in terms of place of residence (the st kilometre rule), occupation, and so on.The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) is a body of independent human rights experts that investigate cases of arbitrary arrest and detention. Arbitrary arrest and detention is the imprisonment or detainment of an individual, by a State, without respect for due process. These actions may be in violation of international human rights law.
The Working Group was established by resolution in  by the former Commission on Human Rights. It is one of the thematic special procedures overseen by the United Nations Human Rights Council, and is therefore a subsidiary body of the UN.
In , Cambridge University Press published The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention: Commentary and Guide to Practice, by international human rights lawyer Jared Genser, who has a – record litigating cases before the body.  This -page treatise is the only book-length how-to guide and commentary on the body's jurisprudence and Genser is now providing this book as a free, publicly available resource for others hoping to bring cases before the Working Group.The World Conference Against Racism (WCAR) is a series of international events organized by UNESCO to promote struggle against racism ideologies and behaviours. Five conferences have been held so far, in , , ,  and . Founded after World War II and the Holocaust as a dependent body of the United Nations, UNESCO started as soon as it was created to promote scientific studies concerning ethnic groups and their diffusion in public opinion to dispel pseudo-scientific rationalizations of racism. One of its first published works was The Race Question in , signed by various internationally renowned scholars.The  World Conference against Racism (WCAR), also known as Durban I, was held at the Durban International Convention Centre in Durban, South Africa, under UN auspices, from  August to  September .
The conference covered several controversial issues, including redress for transatlantic slavery and the second-class citizenry issue in Palestine-Israel. The language of the final Declaration and Programme of Action produced by the conference was strongly disputed in these areas, both in the preparatory meetings in the months that preceded the conference and during the conference itself.
Two delegations, the United States and Israel, withdrew from the conference over objections to a draft document equating Zionism with racism. The final Declaration and Programme of Action did not contain the text that the U.S. and Israel had objected to, that text having been voted out by delegates in the days after the U.S. and Israel withdrew.
In parallel to the conference, a separately held NGO Forum also produced a Declaration and Programme of its own, that was not an official Conference document, which contained language relating to Israel that the WCAR had voted to exclude from its Declaration, and which was criticized by then United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson and many others.
The NGO Forum ended in discord. Mary Robinson lost the support of the United States in her office of High Commissioner, and many of the potential political aftereffects of the conference were annulled by the September ,  attacks. The attacks took place just three days after the conference ended, entirely eclipsing it in the news, and significantly affecting international relations and politics. The conference was followed by the  Durban II conference in Geneva, which was boycotted by ten Western countries. A commemorative Durban III conference in September  in New York has also drawn significant criticism and was boycotted by  Western countries.The World Conference on Human Rights was held by the United Nations in Vienna, Austria, on  to  June . It was the first human rights conference held since the end of the Cold War. The main result of the conference was the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.WORLD WOMAN is a festival of art and activism in Oslo founded in  by filmmaker and activist Deeyah Khan. The festival highlights the voices of artists and activists from around the world and promotes courage, creativity and compassion through human rights, freedom of expression, equality and peace. The event was produced by Fuuse and it took place on the th and  January  in the Riksscenen with the support of Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. WORLD WOMAN is planned as an annual event."
2,fraud,"In law, fraud is intentional deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right. Fraud can violate civil law (e.g., a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud or recover monetary compensation) or criminal law (e.g., a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities), or it may cause no loss of money, property, or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong. The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits, for example by obtaining a passport, travel document, or driver's license, or mortgage fraud, where the perpetrator may attempt to qualify for a mortgage by way of false statements.Internal fraud, also known as ""insider fraud"", is fraud committed or attempted by someone within an organisation such as an employee.A hoax is a distinct concept that involves deliberate deception without the intention of gain or of materially damaging or depriving a victim.The "" day month"" was the basis of ""$. billion in accounting fraud"" regarding ""events regarding an accounting scandal that started in "" at Computer Associates.
The company's ""books were routinely kept open until revenues exceeded projected goals."" Specifics were described as ""a scheme to inflate sales and profits by pretending lucrative contracts were signed earlier than, in fact, they had been. To support this violation of law, faxes of contracts were ""cleaned up ... by removing time stamps ..""The most immediate impact was that it ""cost investors hundreds of millions of dollars,"" although unlike the matters of Worldcom and Enron, to which it was compared, ""Computer Associates - since renamed CA Inc - did not go bankrupt."" An overview by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania wrote that corporate directors, upon seeing signs of ""-day month ... 'the three-day window ... (and) flash period"" ""should be especially vigilant.""Between  and  multiple prepublication manuscripts were stolen via a phishing scheme that investigators believed were conducted by an industry insider or insiders. In  the FBI arrested Filippo Bernardini, a -year-old Italian citizen living in London and working for Simon & Schuster.Academic dishonesty, academic misconduct, academic fraud and academic integrity are related concepts that refer to various actions on the part of students that go against the expected norms of a school, university or other learning institution. Definitions of academic misconduct are usually outlined in institutional policies. Therefore, academic dishonesty consists of many different categories of behaviour, as opposed to  being a singular concept.An accreditation mill is an organization that purports to award educational accreditation to higher education institutions without having government authority or recognition from mainstream academia to operate as an accreditor. Implicit in the terminology is the assumption that the ""mill"" has low standards (or no standards) for such accreditation. Accreditation mills are much like diploma mills, and in many cases are closely associated with diploma mills. The ""accreditation"" they supply has no legal or academic value but is used in diploma mill marketing to help attract students.Some institutions obtain accreditation from an independent group with low standards. In other cases, the institution sets up its own seemingly independent accreditation board and then accredits itself. This gives the appearance that an outside group has approved the education that is offered at the school.
In many countries, accreditation is a government function. In the United States, governments normally do not accredit academic institutions, but federal education authorities recognize about  private accrediting organizations for institutional accreditation of higher education institutions and more than  other private organizations for accreditation of specific educational programs.  While standards vary from organization to organization, without recognition from the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) (a non-governmental organization) or the United States Department of Education, the claims made by independent groups hold no value in the academic community.Ad fraud (also referred to as Click Fraud or PPC Fraud) is concerned with the practice of fraudulently representing online advertisement impressions, clicks, conversion or data events in order to generate revenue. Ad-frauds are particularly popular among cybercriminals  While ad fraud is frequently associated with banner ads, video ads and in-app ads, click fraud has been associated with search marketing, mobile advertising and conversion fraud with affiliate marketing. AppsFlyer estimates financial exposure to app install fraud in Q of  was as much as $ million.Ad fraud is the categorical term inclusive of all forms of online advertising fraud. A successful ad-fraud campaign generally involves a sophisticated combination of Identity fraud and attribution fraud: for instance, sending fake traffic through bots using fake social accounts and falsified cookies; bots will click on the ads available on a scam page that is faking a famous brand. In  Google's CFO George Reyes said that fraud is the biggest threat to internet economy with the first research paper covering the topic in  or earlier. In  World Federation of Advertisers published its first guidance on Ad fraud to advise its members on how to counter the problem allegedly eating close to US$ billion of its members ad budgets in .Address fraud is a type of fraud in which the perpetrator uses an inaccurate or fictitious address to steal money or other benefit, or to hide from authorities. The crime may involve stating one's address as a place where s/he never lived, or continuing to use a previous address where one no longer lives as one's own. Laws pertaining to these types of crimes vary by location.
In one form of address fraud, the perpetrator uses a former address as their current address to receive mail by deliberately failing to report an address change and using the old address on legal documents.In another form, a person misrepresents a communal mail box at their home as their exclusive address to take advantage of benefits available to others in the home.Adoption fraud, also known as illegal adoption, can be defined as when a person or institute attempts to either illegally adopt a child or illegally give up a child for adoption. Common ways in which this can be done include dishonesty and bribes.An advance-fee scam is a form of fraud and is one of the most common types of confidence tricks. The scam typically involves promising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front payment, which the fraudster claims will be used to obtain the large sum. If a victim makes the payment, the fraudster either invents a series of further fees for the victim to pay or simply disappears.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) states that ""An advance fee scheme occurs when the victim pays money to someone in anticipation of receiving something of greater value - such as a loan, contract, investment, or gift - and then receives little or nothing in return."" There are many variations of this type of scam, including the Nigerian prince scam, also known as a  scam. The number """" refers to the section of the Nigerian Criminal Code dealing with fraud and the charges and penalties for such offenders. The scam has been used with fax and traditional mail and is now prevalent in online communications like emails. Other variations include the Spanish Prisoner scam and the black money scam.
Although Nigeria is most often the nation referred to in these scams, they mainly originate in other nations. Other nations known to have a high incidence of advance-fee fraud include: Ivory Coast, Togo, South Africa, the Netherlands, Spain, Poland, and Jamaica.Affinity fraud is a form of investment fraud in which the fraudster preys upon members of identifiable groups, such as religious or ethnic communities, language minorities, the elderly, or professional groups. The fraudsters who promote affinity scams frequently are – or successfully pretend to be – members of the group. They often enlist respected community or religious leaders from within the group to spread the word about the scheme, by convincing those people that a fraudulent investment is legitimate and worthwhile. Many times, those leaders become unwitting victims of the fraudster's ruse.
These scams involve exploitation of the trust and friendship that exist in groups of people who have something in common. Because of the tight-knit structure of many groups, it can be difficult for regulators or law enforcement officials to detect an affinity scam. Victims often fail to notify authorities or pursue legal remedies, and instead try to work things out within the group. This is particularly true where the fraudsters have used respected community or religious leaders to convince others to join the investment.
Many affinity scams involve Ponzi schemes or pyramid schemes, where newly received investor money is used by the fraudster to make payments to earlier investors to give the illusion that the investment is successful. This ploy is used to trick new investors to invest in the scheme and to lull existing investors into believing their investments are safe and secure. In reality, the fraudster almost always steals investor money for personal use. Both types of schemes depend on an unending supply of new investors; when the supply of investors inevitably dries up, the whole scheme collapses and investors discover that most or all of their money is gone.Age fabrication occurs when people deliberately misrepresent their true age. This is usually done with the intention to garner privileges or status that would not otherwise be available to that person (i.e., a minor misrepresenting their age in order to garner the privileges given to adults). It may be done through the use of oral or written statements or through the altering, doctoring or forging of vital records.
On some occasions, age is increased so as to make cut-offs for minimum legal or employable age in showbusiness or professional sports. Sometimes it is not the people themselves who lower their public age, but others around them such as publicists, parents, and other handlers.  Most cases involve taking or adding one or two years to their age. However, in more extreme cases such as with Al Lewis and Charo, a decade has been added or subtracted. Official state documents (such as birth, marriage and death certificates, the census, and other identity documents) typically provide the correct date.
Although uncommon in modern Western society, it is still possible for a person not to know their exact date of birth. Such a person may arbitrarily choose a date of birth which after later research is found to be false. This situation should not be considered age fabrication as there is no obvious intent to deceive on the part of the individual.
Subtracting time from one's age is often known in English as ""shaving"", while adding time to one's age may be referred to as ""napping"".Age fraud is age fabrication or the use of false documentation to gain an advantage over opponents. In football, it is common amongst players belonging to nations where records are not easily verifiable. The media often refer to the player with false documentation as an ""age-cheat"".
There are several reasons why players choose to use false documentation. European scouts are looking for young talented players from poorer countries to sign for a European club. The players know that there is a lesser chance of being signed if they are, for example,  years old as opposed to  years old as there would be less time for the club to develop the player.
Age fabrication also allows an older player to enter in youth competitions. FIFA says that ""over-age players have been wrongly entered into various youth competitions, often benefiting from an unfair advantage due to their greater physical maturity compared to players of the proper age.""In some cases, it is possible for the player not to know their own date of birth and make an approximate guess when it comes to gaining official documents.Artificial intelligence is used by many different businesses and organizations. It is widely used in the financial sector, especially by accounting firms, to help detect fraud.
In , PricewaterhouseCoopers reported that fraud has impacted % of all businesses in the world. The shift from working in person to working from home has brought an increased access to data. A  report by the FTC shows that consumers reported nearly . billion dollars in fraud in , a % increase from the previous year. A majority of these scams were online shopping fraud, along with imposter scams.Authorized push payment fraud (APP fraud) is a form of fraud in which victims are manipulated into making real-time payments to fraudsters, typically by social engineering attacks involving impersonation. These authorised frauds can also be related to investment scams where the victim is tricked into sending money for investments that don't exist, and romance scams where the fraudster tricks the victim into thinking they are in a relationship. As of  in the United Kingdom, because the victims of these frauds authorized the payments, albeit mistakenly, they are typically not fully reimbursed by their banks. From May  some victims will receive a refund under the Contingent Reimbursement Model Scheme. This is a voluntary code on Authorized Push Payment scams that provides protections for customers of signatory firms but also contains a number of exclusions.


== References ==Bait-and-switch is a form of fraud used in retail sales but also employed in other contexts. First, customers are ""baited"" by merchants' advertising products or services at a low price, but when customers visit the store, they discover that the advertised goods are not available, or the customers are pressured by salespeople to consider similar, but higher-priced items (""switching"").
Bait-and-switch techniques have a long and widespread history as a part of commercial culture. Many variations on the bait-and-switch appear, for example, in China's earliest book of stories about fraud, Zhang Yingyu's The Book of Swindles (c. ).The Bouvier Affair was a number of international lawsuits that started in , and subsequent events. The lawsuits allege that Swiss art shipper and dealer Yves Bouvier defrauded his clients by misrepresenting the original cost of art works and subsequently overcharging them. The affair has played out in courts in Monaco, Switzerland, France, the US, Hong Kong and Singapore.  
The alleged victims are ""high net worth individuals"" in the UK, the US, Asia and Europe, most notably Monaco-based Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev.As of February , Bouvier was facing criminal charges in France, Monaco and also in Switzerland after the Geneva Prosecutor opened a new case there.Brand protection is the process and set of actions that a right holder undertakes to prevent third parties from using its intellectual property without permission, as this may cause loss of revenue and, usually more importantly, destroys  brand equity, reputation and  trust. Brand protection seeks  primarily to ensure that trademarks, patents, and copyrights are respected, though other intellectual property rights such as industrial design rights or trade dress can be involved.  Counterfeiting is the umbrella term to designate  infringements to intellectual property, with the exception of the term  piracy which  is  sometimes (colloquially)  used to refer to copyright infringement.A more narrow definition of  brand protection which focuses on trademark infringement,  is sometimes used.  Counterfeiting of physical goods that  involves trademark infringement is indeed one of the predominant forms of intellectual property infringement. However,  both copyright and patent infringement  are possible without an associated trademark infringement,  and both may result in loss of revenue and of brand equity.  Eliminating diversion, gray market, or product theft and resale, are generally considered as well as  part of a brand protection strategy, even though  an intellectual property may not be necessarily infringed.A brass plate company or brass plate trust is a legally constituted company lacking meaningful connection with the location of incorporation. The name is based on a company whose only tangible existence in its jurisdiction of incorporation is the nameplate attached to the wall outside its registered office. The registered office is often the same office and address of the local professional service firm(s) or corporate service provider(s) (CSPs), (i.e. legal, accounting or secretarial etc.) who act as local support to the company. Brass plate structures are associated with tax havens, corporate tax havens, and offshore financial centres.A bride scam is a form of romance scam - a confidence trick that aims to defraud potential grooms with the offer of a foreign bride. The basis of the confidence trick is to seek men from the western world who would like to marry a foreign woman and pretend to be willing to marry them. The woman (scammer) asks the man to send money, for example, for the purposes of purchasing an airline ticket or a visa they have no intention of buying. The relationship ends after requested money has been wired and received, sometimes after multiple transfers have been made.
This phenomenon increased in number with the rise of the internet with its online dating sites and online chats.Butsukari otoko (ぶつかり男, 'Bumping man') means a man who deliberately does a ramming attack against a woman within a station precinct.They are also called Takkuru otoko (タックル男, 'Tackle men'), Taiatari otoko (体当たり男, 'Ramming men') and Butsukari ojisan (ぶつかりおじさん, 'Bumping old men')A card-not-present transaction (CNP, mail order / telephone order, MO/TO) is a payment card transaction made where the cardholder does not or cannot physically present the card for a merchant's visual examination at the time that an order is given and payment effected. It is most commonly used for payments made over the Internet, but can also be used with mail-order transactions by mail or fax, or over the telephone.
Card-not-present transactions are a major route for credit card fraud, because it is difficult for a merchant to verify that the actual cardholder is indeed authorizing a purchase.
If a fraudulent CNP transaction is reported, the acquiring bank hosting the merchant account that received the money from the fraudulent transaction must make restitution to the cardholder, which is called a chargeback. This is the opposite of a card present transaction, when the issuer of the card is liable for restitution. Because of the greater risk, some card issuers charge a greater transaction fee to merchants who routinely handle card-not-present transactions.
The card security code (commonly CVV) system has been set up to reduce the incidence of credit card fraud arising from CNP.The Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) is a credential awarded by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) since . The ACFE association is a provider of anti-fraud training and education. Founded in  by Dr. Joseph T Wells. The ACFE established and administers the Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE) credential.To become a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE), one must meet the following requirements:
Be an Associate Member of the ACFE in good standing
Meet minimum academic and professional requirements (undergraduate degree and professional experience (Note: a combination of graduate or post-graduate education and experience can be used to increase eligibility, however most importantly a candidate must score  points or above based on eligibility criteria).
Be of high moral character
Agree to abide by the Bylaws and Code of Professional Ethics of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners
Pass the CFE ExaminationCGK was a synthetic chemical substance  which was reported in  to have remarkable properties in reversing cell senescence (aging).  However, the entire work behind the discovery of this compound has since been found to be falsified and the authors of the original reports have retracted all their claims.CGK was claimed to be an inhibitor of ATM/ATR kinases, which are involved in DNA damage repair.   CGK was claimed to extend the lifetime of cultured cells by approximately  divisions, or roughly %, specifically in mammalian cells.
The original report garnered scientific attention, but was retracted in .   The retraction states that the screen to identify CGK as an anti-senescence agent was not carried out; experiments exploring the cellular effects of CGK were misrepresented; the identification of ATM as the target of CGK was fabricated; a compound which was essential for ATM target validation had not been synthesized; and the chemical structure of CGK was misrepresented.The principal investigator, Tae Kook Kim, and several associates  were consequently suspended from their positions at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology.


== References ==Charity fraud is the act of using deception to get money from people who believe they are making donations to a charity.  Often a person or a group of people will make material representations that they are a charity or part of a charity and ask prospective donors for contributions to the non-existent charity. Charity fraud not only includes fictitious charities but also deceitful business acts. Deceitful business acts include businesses accepting donations and not using the money for its intended purposes, or soliciting funds under the pretense of need.Check washing is the process of erasing details from checks to allow them to be rewritten, usually for criminal purposes such as fraudulent withdrawal from the victim's bank account.Various steps can be taken by the writer of the check to reduce the possibility of falling victim to check washing. These include mailing checks by placing them in secured mailboxes, using secure ink dispensed from a gel, rollerball, or fountain pen, filling in all lines on the check, and careful scrutiny of bank statements.
The actual process of washing a check is relatively simple and can be accomplished with basic solvents. The actual solvent is largely irrelevant — more importantly, the polarity of the solvent must match the polarity of the dye in the ink. For example, an ink that is mostly made of a polar dye would require a polar solvent (e.g. acetone or isopropanol). Both nail polish remover (acetone) and rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) are able to pull most common inks away from paper in minutes. Similarly, a non-polar dye would require a non-polar solvent (e.g. toluene or a similar hydrocarbon).Cheque fraud (British English), or check fraud (American English), refers to a category of criminal acts that involve making the unlawful use of cheques  in order to illegally acquire or borrow funds that do not exist within the account balance or account-holder's legal ownership. Most methods involve taking advantage of the float (the time between the negotiation of the cheque and its clearance at the cheque writer's financial institution) to draw out these funds. Specific kinds of cheque fraud include cheque kiting, where funds are deposited before the end of the float period to cover the fraud, and paper hanging, where the float offers the opportunity to write fraudulent cheques but the account is never replenished.The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, or Claims Conference, represents the world's Jews in negotiating for compensation and restitution for victims of Nazi persecution and their heirs. According to Section ()() of the Property Law of Germany, the claims Conference is a legal successor with  respect to the claims not filed on time by Jewish persons. This fact was reasserted in decisions of some lawsuits which attempted to redefine the Claims Conference as a ""trustee"" of these assets. These lawsuits were dismissed. The Claims Conference administers compensation funds, recovers unclaimed Jewish property, and allocates funds to institutions that provide social welfare services to Holocaust survivors and preserve the memory and lessons of the Holocaust. Julius Berman has led the organization as chairman of the board, and currently president, as of .Clothing scam companies are companies or gangs that purport to be collecting second-hand clothes for charities or to be working for charitable causes, when they are in fact working for themselves, selling the clothes overseas and giving little if anything to charitable causes. They are a particular problem in the United Kingdom, where they rely on people's awareness of proper charities established practise of collecting used clothes for good causes. These companies cause major problems for established charities in terms of lost donations and making the public distrustful of all clothes collectors.Coin-rolling related scams are a collection of scams involving coin wrappers (rolls of coins). The scammer will roll coins of lesser value or slugs of no value, or less than the correct number of coins in a roll, then exchange them at a bank or retail outlet for cash.
To prevent these problems, many banks will require people turning in coins to have an account, and will debit the customer's account in the event of a shorted roll. Some banks also have machines to count coins.A coin-matching game (also a coin smack or smack game) is a confidence trick in which two con artists set up one victim.
The first con artist strikes up a conversation with the victim, usually while waiting somewhere. The con artist suggests matching pennies (or other coins) to pass the time. The second con artist arrives and joins in, but soon leaves for a moment. The first con artist then suggests cheating. The victim, thinking they are going to scam the second con artist, agrees to match coins each time.
When the second con artist returns and begins losing, he accuses the two of cheating and threatens to call the police. The first con artist offers a sizable sum of hush money, and the victim contributes something too. After the victim leaves, the two con artists split up the money extorted from the victim.In game theory the term refers to a zero-sum two-person game of imperfect information (not involving a third player or collusion); other variations on the name are ""matching coins"" or ""matching pennies"".


== References ==A confidence trick is an attempt to defraud a person or group after first gaining their trust. Confidence tricks exploit victims using their credulity, naïveté, compassion, vanity, confidence, irresponsibility, and greed. Researchers have defined confidence tricks as ""a distinctive species of fraudulent conduct [...] intending to further voluntary exchanges that are not mutually beneficial"", as they ""benefit con operators ('con men') at the expense of their victims (the 'marks')"".Control fraud occurs when a trusted person in a high position of responsibility in a company, corporation, or state subverts the organization and engages in extensive fraud for personal gain.  The term ""control fraud"" was coined by William K. Black to refer both to the acts of fraud and to the individuals who commit them.A copyfraud is a false copyright claim by an individual or institution with respect to content that is in the public domain. Such claims are wrongful, at least under US and Australian copyright law, because material that is not copyrighted is free for all to use, modify and reproduce. Copyfraud also includes overreaching claims by publishers, museums and others, as where a legitimate copyright owner knowingly, or with constructive knowledge, claims rights beyond what the law allows.
The term copyfraud was coined by Jason Mazzone, a Professor of Law at the University of Illinois. Because copyfraud carries little or no oversight by authorities and few legal consequences, it exists on a massive scale, with millions of works in the public domain falsely labelled as copyrighted.  Payments are therefore unnecessarily made by businesses and individuals for licensing fees. Mazzone states that copyfraud stifles valid reproduction of free material, discourages innovation and undermines free speech rights.:   Other legal scholars have suggested public and private remedies, and a few cases have been brought involving copyfraud.Ellen Corkrum is a Liberian/ Ghanaian philanthropist politician and presidential candidate, and convicted criminal, who previously served as an officer in the United States military and as a commercial pilot.
She served as the managing director of the Liberia Airports Authority, and was forced to flee the country after exposing alleged corruption in the government. She has announced her candidacy for President of Liberia in the  election.
Born in Liberia, she moved to Minnesota at age . Corkrum served as a U.S. military Black Hawk assault helicopter pilot, a major in the United States Armed Forces reserves, and a commercial airline pilot. She is a graduate of Harvard University, with a Master Degree in Public Administration. Corkrum also holds an MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Corkrum returned Liberia to work as the managing director of the Liberia Airports Authority. After reporting the corruption she witnessed, her life was threatened and a campaign of public intimidation was launched. She escaped from Liberia, by road, through Sierra Leone, then Europe before making it back to the U.S. The current Liberian National Police Director, Chris Massaquoi, defied the President’s orders and helped Corkrum escape, stating that he was part of a top-level meeting where her capture was revealed. Liberia’s Minister of Defense, Brownie Samukai is also heard on tape, revealing to Corkrum that top government officials had set her up to cover their fraudulent practices. Corkrum secretly recorded these and other officials, including the executive office. Corkrum presented this evidence, including a -page binder of documentation to the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Justice  Department.Credit card kiting refers to the use of one or more credit cards to obtain cash and purchasing power they do not have, or pay credit card balances with the proceeds of other cards. Unlike check kiting, which is illegal under nearly all circumstances, laws against credit card kiting are not completely prohibitive of the practice, thereby allowing it to be done to some degree. It is up to the banks to detect the practice and when necessary, stop it.
In order for prosecution to occur in a credit card kiting scheme, a bank must prove intent to deceive. Et seq. reference infers paying credit card minimum balances with credit card proceeds is de facto evidence of deceit.CUC (Comp-U-Card) International Inc. was a membership-based consumer services conglomerate with travel, shopping, auto, dining, home improvement and financial services offered to more than  million customers worldwide based in Stamford, Connecticut, USA, and founded in  by Kirk Shelton and Walter Forbes. In , it became involved in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into what, at the time, was the biggest accounting scandal in corporate history.== Introduction ==
Fraud that involves cell phones, insurance claims, tax return claims, credit card transactions, government procurement etc. represent significant problems for governments and businesses and specialized analysis techniques for discovering fraud using them are required. These methods exist in the areas of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), Data Mining, Machine Learning and Statistics. They offer applicable and successful solutions in different areas of electronic fraud crimes.In general, the primary reason to use data analytics techniques is to tackle fraud since many internal control systems have serious weaknesses. For example, the currently prevailing approach employed by many law enforcement agencies to detect companies involved in potential cases of fraud consists in receiving circumstantial evidence or complaints from whistleblowers. As a result, a large number of fraud cases remain undetected and unprosecuted. In order to effectively test, detect, validate, correct error and monitor control systems against fraudulent activities, businesses entities and organizations rely on specialized data analytics techniques such as data mining, data matching, sounds like function, Regression analysis, Clustering analysis and Gap. Techniques used for fraud detection fall into two primary classes: statistical techniques and artificial intelligence.The Death Star strategy (named after the Death Star space station and weapon from the movie Star Wars) was the name Enron gave to their practice of shuffling energy around the California power grid to receive payments from the state for ""relieving congestion"". According to the company's own memo they would be paid ""for moving energy to relieve congestion, without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.""
For example, if the California power grid was congested with energy flowing south, Enron would schedule energy to be transmitted north to Oregon. They would receive a payment from California for apparently relieving congestion on the grid. Then Enron would schedule the energy to be transferred back to its point of origin, but not through California. Ultimately the energy would end up right back where it started, and Enron would be paid by California without actually putting any electricity on their grid.
The firm acknowledged in internal documents the inherent ethical dilemmas, in one internal document stating ""Traders could buy power at $ and sell it for $,. Doing so appears not to present any problems, other than a public relations risk arising from the fact that such exports may have contributed to California's declaration of a Stage  Emergency yesterday.""Digital kidnapping is the theft of a minor's photos, posing as them, or posing as their parents. DK is commonly done to reveal private or sensitive information that negatively impacts the child's life, making it difficult to gain acceptance to college, or subjecting them to bullying. In rare cases, a kidnapper may assume the identity of a parent, making the impostor's followers believe that they are the child's parent. By posing as a peer or authority figure, adults may also gather information about minors, and use it in real world crimes, such as kidnapping.Domain name scams are types of Intellectual property scams or confidence scams in which unscrupulous domain name registrars attempt to generate revenue by tricking businesses into buying, selling, listing or converting a domain name.  The Office of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom has outlined two types of domain name scams which are ""Domain name registration scams"" and ""Domain name renewal scams"".Double billing refers to charging for the same product twice.Drug fraud is a type of fraud in which drugs, legal or illegal, are cut or altered in such a way that diminishes their value below that which they are sold for.Electoral fraud, sometimes referred to as election manipulation, voter fraud or vote rigging, involves illegal interference with the process of an election, either by increasing the vote share of a favored candidate, depressing the vote share of rival candidates, or both. It differs from but often goes hand-in-hand with voter suppression. What exactly constitutes electoral fraud varies from country to country.
Electoral legislation outlaws many kinds of election fraud, but other practices violate general laws, such as those banning assault, harassment or libel. Although technically the term ""electoral fraud"" covers only those acts which are illegal, the term is sometimes used to describe acts which are legal, but considered morally unacceptable, outside the spirit of an election or in violation of the principles of democracy. Show elections, featuring only one candidate, are sometimes classified as electoral fraud, although they may comply with the law and are presented more as referendums/plebiscites.
In national elections, successful electoral fraud on a sufficient scale can have the effect of a coup d'état, protest or corruption of democracy. In a narrow election, a small amount of fraud may suffice to change the result. Even if the outcome is not affected, the revelation of fraud can reduce voters' confidence in democracy.Email spoofing is the creation of email messages with a forged sender address. The term applies to email purporting to be from an address which is not actually the sender's; mail sent in reply to that address may bounce or be delivered to an unrelated party whose identity has been faked. Masked email is a different topic, providing a ""masked"" email address that is not the user's normal address, which is not disclosed (for example, so that it cannot be harvested), but forwards mail sent to it to the user's real address.The original transmission protocols used for email do not have built-in authentication methods: this deficiency allows spam and phishing emails to use spoofing in order to mislead the recipient. More recent countermeasures have made such spoofing from internet sources more difficult but not eliminated it; few internal networks have defenses against a spoof email from a colleague's compromised computer on that network. Individuals and businesses deceived by spoof emails may suffer significant financial losses; in particular, spoofed emails are often used to infect computers with ransomware.Embezzlement is a crime that consists of withholding assets for the purpose of conversion of such assets, by one or more persons to whom the assets were entrusted, either to be held or to be used for specific purposes. Embezzlement is a type of financial fraud. For example, a lawyer might embezzle funds from the trust accounts of their clients; a financial advisor might embezzle the funds of investors; and a husband or a wife might embezzle funds from a bank account jointly held with the spouse.The term ""embezzlement"" is often used in informal speech to mean theft of money, usually from an organization or company such as an employer.
Embezzlement is usually a premeditated crime, performed methodically, with precautions that conceal the criminal conversion of the property, which occurs without the knowledge or consent of the affected person. Often it involves the trusted individual embezzling only a small proportion of the total of the funds or resources they receive or control, in an attempt to minimize the risk of the detection of the misallocation of the funds or resources. When successful, embezzlement may continue for many years without detection.Employment fraud is the attempt to defraud people seeking employment by giving them false hope of better employment, offering better working hours, more respectable tasks, future opportunities, or higher wages. They often advertise at the same locations as genuine employers and may ask for money in exchange for the opportunity to apply for a job.An essay mill (also term paper mill) is a business that allows customers to commission an original piece of writing on a particular topic so that they may commit academic fraud. Customers provide the company with specific information about the essay, including: a page length, a general topic, and a time frame with which to work. The customer is then charged a certain amount per page. The similar essay bank concept is a company from which students can purchase pre-written but less expensive essays on various topics, at higher risk of being caught. Both forms of business are under varying legal restraints in some jurisdictions.Extrinsic fraud is fraud that induces one not to present a case in court or deprives one of the opportunity to be heard or is not involved in the actual issues. More broadly, it is defined as:

fraudulent acts which keep a person from obtaining information about his/her rights to enforce a contract or getting evidence to defend against a lawsuit. This could include destroying evidence or misleading an ignorant person about the right to sue. Extrinsic fraud is distinguished from intrinsic fraud, which is the fraud that is the subject of a lawsuit.
Extrinsic fraud often involves fraud on the court, but may arise in other contexts. Extrinsic fraud does not mean merely lying or perjury, nor misrepresentations, nor intrinsic fraud, nor ""to matters that could have been raised during the divorce proceeding.""  It must involve ""collateral ... circumstances"" such as:

""bribery of a judge or juror,""
""fabrication of evidence by an attorney,""
""preventing another party's witness from appearing,""
""intentionally failing to join a necessary party,"" or
""misleading another party into thinking a continuance had been granted....""The U.S. Supreme Court distinguished extrinsic fraud from intrinsic fraud in the  case United States v. Throckmorton. Where, ""by reason of something done by the successful party to a suit, there was in fact no adversary trial or decision of the issue in the case"", an unsuccessful litigant is entitled to equitable relief from the judgement thus obtained, or a new trial if the fraud prevented that from happening.The impact factor (IF) or journal impact factor (JIF) of an academic journal is a scientometric index calculated by Clarivate that reflects the yearly mean number of citations of articles published in the last two years in a given journal, as indexed by Clarivate's Web of Science. As a journal-level metric, it is frequently used as a proxy for the relative importance of a journal within its field; journals with higher impact factor values are given the status of being more important, or carry more prestige in their respective fields, than those with lower values. While frequently used by universities and funding bodies to decide on promotion and research proposals, it has come under attack for distorting good scientific practices.A faked death, also called a staged death or pseudocide, is the act of an individual purposely deceiving other people into believing that the individual is dead, when the person is, in fact, still alive. People who commit pseudocide can do so by leaving evidence, clues, or through other methods.  In fandom slang, pseudocide is faking a suicide. Death hoaxes can also be created and spread solely by third-parties for various purposes.
Committing pseudocide may be done for a variety of reasons, such as to fraudulently collect insurance money, to evade pursuit, to escape from captivity, to arouse false sympathy, or as a practical joke.
While faking one's own death is not inherently illegal, it may be part of a fraudulent or illicit activity such as tax evasion, insurance fraud,:   or avoiding a criminal prosecution.False advertising is defined as the act of publishing, transmitting, or otherwise publicly circulating an advertisement containing a false claim, or statement, made intentionally (or recklessly) to promote the sale of property, goods, or services. A false advertisement can be classified as deceptive if the advertiser deliberately misleads the consumer, rather than making an unintentional mistake. A number of governments use regulations to limit false advertising.Fertility fraud is the failure on the part of a fertility doctor to obtain consent from a patient before inseminating her with his own sperm. This normally occurs in the context of people using assisted reproductive technology (ART) to address fertility issues.
The term is also used in cases where donor eggs are used without consent and more broadly, in instances where doctors and other medical professionals exploit opportunities that arise when people use assisted reproductive technology to address fertility issues. This may give rise to a number of different types of fraud involving insurance, unnecessary procedures, theft of eggs, and other issues related to fertility treatment.Foreign exchange fraud is any trading scheme used to defraud traders by convincing them that they can expect to gain a high profit by trading in the foreign exchange market. Currency trading became a common form of fraud in early , according to Michael Dunn of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.The foreign exchange market is at best a zero-sum game,
meaning that whatever one trader gains, another loses. However, brokerage commissions and other transaction costs are subtracted from the results of all traders, making foreign exchange a negative-sum game.Fraud deterrence has gained public recognition and spotlight since the  inception of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Of the many reforms enacted through Sarbanes-Oxley, one major goal was to regain public confidence in the reliability of financial markets in the wake of corporate scandals such as Enron, WorldCom and Waste Management. Section  of Sarbanes Oxley mandated that public companies have an independent Audit of internal controls over financial reporting. In essence, the intent of the U.S. Congress in passing the Sarbanes Oxley Act was attempting to proactively deter financial misrepresentation (Fraud) in order to ensure more accurate financial reporting to increase investor confidence. This same concept is applied in the discussion of fraud deterrence.
Until recently, fraud deterrence has not been specifically identified under one common definition. While it has been discussed by many authoritative sources such as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Practice Aid Series, ""Fraud Detection in a GAAS Audit: SAS No.  Implementation Guide,"" (explicitly) The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), ""Internal Control – Integrated Framework,"" (implicitly) and the National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts Certified Fraud Deterrence Analyst (CFD) designation (recently merged into the Certified Forensic Financial Analyst (CFFA) designation), an actual definition of the term ""fraud deterrence"" has been difficult to find.Fraud in the factum is a type of fraud where misrepresentation causes one to enter a transaction without accurately realizing the risks, duties, or obligations incurred.  This can be when the maker or drawer of a negotiable instrument, such as a promissory note or check, is induced to sign the instrument without a reasonable opportunity to learn of its fraudulent character or essential terms.  Determination of whether an act constitutes fraud in the factum depends upon consideration of ""all relevant factors"".  Fraud in the factum usually voids the instrument under state law and is a real defense against even a holder in due course.
Contrast this with the situation where a trusted employee signs a check without permission.  The employer must still honor the check despite the fact that the check was a fraudulent negotiable instrument.  Here, the employer had a reasonable opportunity to avoid the obligation by restricting access to the checks.
Fraud in the factum is often contrasted with fraud in the inducement.

Fraud in the factum is a legal defense, and occurs where A makes/signs an agreement, but either does not realize that it is supposed to be a contract, or does not understand the nature/content of the agreement, because of some false information that B gave to A.  For example, suppose John tells his mother that he is taking a college course on Handwriting Analysis, and for his homework he needs her to read and sign a pretend deed.  If Mom signs the deed believing what he told her, and John tries to enforce the deed, Mom can plead ""fraud in the factum"".
Fraud in the inducement is an equitable defense, and occurs when A enters into an agreement, knowing that it is supposed to be a contract and (at least having a rough idea) what the agreement is about, but the reason A signed/made the agreement was because of some false information that B gave to A.  For example, suppose John tells his mother to sign a deed giving him her property, Mom refuses at first, but then John falsely tells her that the bank will foreclose on the property unless she signs it over to him.  If Mom signs the deed because of this statement from John, and John tries to enforce the deed, Mom can plead ""fraud in the inducement"".A fraudulent conveyance, or fraudulent transfer, is an attempt to avoid debt by transferring money to another person or company. It is generally a civil, not a criminal matter, meaning that one cannot go to jail for it, but in some jurisdictions there is potential for criminal prosecution. It is generally treated as a civil cause of action that arises in debtor/creditor relations, particularly with reference to insolvent debtors.  The cause of action is typically brought by creditors or by bankruptcy trustees.Geneivat da'at or g'neivat daat or genebath da'ath (Hebrew: גניבת דעת, lit. 'theft of the mind', from Hebrew  גנבה  'stealing', and  דעת  'knowledge') is a concept in Jewish law and ethics that refers to a kind of dishonest misrepresentation or deception. It is applied in a wide spectrum of interpersonal situations, especially in business transactions.Gone in  Seconds was a fraud scheme uncovered in  involving the theft of over $ million from Citibank using cash advance kiosks at casinos located in Southern California and Nevada.The green goods scam, also known as the ""green goods game"", was a fraud scheme popular in the th-century United States in which people were duped into paying for worthless counterfeit money. It is a variation on the pig-in-a-poke scam using money instead of other goods like a pig.
In the typical green goods scam, the mark, or victim, would respond to flyers circulated throughout the country by the scammers (""green goods men"") which claimed to offer ""genuine"" counterfeit currency for sale. This currency was sometimes alleged to have been printed with stolen engraving plates. Victims, usually living outside major cities, would be enticed to travel to the location of the green goods men to complete the transaction. Victims were guided by a ""steerer"" to be shown large amounts of genuine currency – represented to be counterfeit – which was then placed in a bag or satchel. Victims then received offers to purchase the money at a price much less than face value. While a victim negotiated a price or was otherwise distracted, another accomplice (the ""ringer"") would switch the bag of money for a bag containing sawdust, green paper, or other worthless items. Victims would leave unaware of the switch, and were unwilling to report the crime, as attempting to purchase counterfeit currency was itself a crime and the victim risked arrest.Health care fraud includes ""snake oil"" marketing, health insurance fraud, drug fraud, and medical fraud. Health insurance fraud occurs when a company or an individual defrauds an insurer or government health care program, such as Medicare (United States) or equivalent State programs. The manner in which this is done varies, and persons engaging in fraud are always seeking new ways to circumvent the law. Damages from fraud can be recovered by use of the False Claims Act, most commonly under the qui tam provisions which rewards an individual for being a ""whistleblower"", or relator (law).Heraldic fraud may mean either to falsely claim the right to a coat of arms (or other component of heraldic display) for oneself, or to falsely assert that someone else has that right in order to sell heraldic art to them. Both can be seen as a kind of fraud and an infringement of intellectual property rights.
According to the law of arms in most heraldic jurisdictions, usage of a pre-existing coat of arms must be predicated on some form of family relationship. Typically, inheritance of arms flows through the male line, though in many traditions it may flow through the female line as well.

The term ""bucket shop"" is sometimes used to refer to a company that will sell a coat of arms (often referred to by the misnomer ""family crest"") associated with the customer's surname, regardless of whether the customer can actually claim a relation to the original armiger. Bucket shops may work from a database of surnames and shields sourced from manuscripts, armorials, and various journals. A common indicator of ""bucket shop"" arms is the display of the surname within what should be the motto scroll.The Hitler Diaries (German: Hitler-Tagebücher) were a series of sixty volumes of journals purportedly written by Adolf Hitler, but in fact forged by Konrad Kujau between  and . The diaries were purchased in  for . million Deutsche Marks (£. million or US$. million) by the West German news magazine Stern, which sold serialisation rights to several news organisations. One was the British newspaper The Sunday Times, whose independent director, the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, pronounced them genuine; Trevor-Roper and several other academics were misled by Stern journalists who had misinformed them about the extent of chemical testing done on the documents, as well as its East German source, in an effort to conceal the discovery from other publications. Eventually, at a press conference to announce the publication, Trevor-Roper announced that he had changed his mind, and other historians also questioned their validity. Rigorous forensic analysis, which had not been performed previously, quickly confirmed that the diaries were fakes.
Kujau, born and raised in East Germany, had a history of petty crime and deception. During the mid-s, he began selling Nazi memorabilia which he had smuggled from the East, but found he could increase the prices by forging additional authentication details to associate ordinary souvenirs with the Nazi leadership. Kujau began forging paintings by Hitler and an increasing number of notes, poems and letters, until he produced his first diary during the mid- to-late s. The West German journalist with Stern who ""discovered"" the diaries and was involved in their purchase was Gerd Heidemann, who had an obsession with the Nazi era. When Stern started buying the diaries, Heidemann stole a significant proportion of the money.
Kujau and Heidemann spent time in prison for their parts in the fraud, and several newspaper editors lost their jobs. The story of the scandal was the basis for the movies Selling Hitler () for the British channel ITV, the German cinema release Schtonk! (), and the television series Faking Hitler.A hoax is a widely publicized falsehood so fashioned as to invite reflexive, unthinking acceptance by the greatest number of people of the most varied social identities and of the highest possible social pretensions to gull its victims into putting up the highest possible social currency in support of the hoax.Whereas the promoters of frauds, fakes, and scams devise them so that they will withstand the highest degree of scrutiny customary in the affair, hoaxers are confident, justifiably or not, that their representations will receive no scrutiny at all.  They have such confidence  because their representations belong to a world of notions fundamental to the victims' views of reality, but whose truth and importance they accept without argument or evidence, and so never question. 
Some hoaxers intend eventually to unmask their representations as in fact a hoax so as to expose their victims as fools; seeking some form of profit, other hoaxers hope to maintain the hoax indefinitely, so that it is only when sceptical persons willing to investigate their claims publish their findings that at last they stand revealed as hoaxers.Identity theft occurs when someone uses another person's personal identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or credit card number, without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. The term identity theft was coined in . Since that time, the definition of identity theft has been statutorily defined throughout both the U.K. and the U.S. as the theft of personally identifiable information. Identity theft deliberately uses someone else's identity as a method to gain financial advantages or obtain credit and other benefits, and perhaps to cause other person's disadvantages or loss. The person whose identity has been stolen may suffer adverse consequences, especially if they are falsely held responsible for the perpetrator's actions. Personally identifiable information generally includes a person's name, date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, bank account or credit card numbers, PINs, electronic signatures, fingerprints, passwords, or any other information that can be used to access a person's financial resources.Determining the link between data breaches and identity theft is challenging, primarily because identity theft victims often do not know how their personal information was obtained. According to a report done for the FTC, identity theft is not always detectable by the individual victims. Identity fraud is often but not necessarily the consequence of identity theft. Someone can steal or misappropriate personal information without then committing identity theft using the information about every person, such as when a major data breach occurs. A U.S. Government Accountability Office study determined that ""most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft"". The report also warned that ""the full extent is unknown"". A later unpublished study by Carnegie Mellon University noted that ""Most often, the causes of identity theft is not known"", but reported that someone else concluded that ""the probability of becoming a victim to identity theft as a result of a data breach is ... around only %"". For example, in one of the largest data breaches which affected over four million records, it resulted in only about , instances of identity theft, according to the company whose systems were breached.An October  article entitled ""Cyber Crime Made Easy"" explained the level to which hackers are using malicious software. As Gunter Ollmann,
Chief Technology Officer of security at Microsoft, said, ""Interested in credit card theft?  There's an app for that.""  This statement summed up the ease with which these hackers are accessing all kinds of information online. The new program for infecting users' computers was called Zeus, and the program is so hacker-friendly that even an inexperienced hacker can operate it. Although the hacking program is easy to use, that fact does not diminish the devastating effects that Zeus (or other software like Zeus) can do on a computer and the user.  For example, programs like Zeus can steal credit card information, important documents, and even documents necessary for homeland security. If a hacker were to gain this information, it would mean identity theft or even a possible terrorist attack. The ITAC says that about  million Americans had their identity stolen in .An inauthentic text is a computer-generated expository document meant to appear as genuine, but which is actually meaningless.  Frequently they are created in order to be intermixed with genuine documents and thus manipulate the results of search engines, as with Spam blogs.  They are also carried along in email in order to fool spam filters by giving the spam the superficial characteristics of legitimate text.
Sometimes nonsensical documents are created with computer assistance for humorous effect, as with Dissociated press or Flarf poetry.  They have also been used to challenge the veracity of a publication—MIT students submitted papers generated by a computer program called SCIgen to a conference, where they were initially accepted.  This led the students to claim that the bar for submissions was too low.
With the amount of computer generated text outpacing the ability of people to humans to curate it, there needs some means of distinguishing between the two.  Yet automated approaches to determining absolutely whether a text is authentic or not face intrinsic challenges of semantics.  Noam Chomsky coined the phrase ""Colorless green ideas sleep furiously"" giving an example of grammatically-correct, but semantically incoherent sentence; some will point out that in certain contexts one could give this sentence (or any phrase) meaning.
The first group to use the expression in this regard can be found below from Indiana University.  Their work explains in detail an attempt to detect inauthentic texts and identify pernicious problems of inauthentic texts in cyberspace.  The site has a means of submitting text that assesses, based on supervised learning, whether a corpus is inauthentic or not.  Many users have submitted incorrect types of data and have correspondingly commented on the scores. This application is meant for a specific kind of data; therefore, submitting, say, an email, will not return a meaningful score.Insurance fraud is any act committed to defraud an insurance process. It occurs when a claimant attempts to obtain some benefit or advantage they are not entitled to, or when an insurer knowingly denies some benefit that is due. According to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, the most common schemes include premium diversion, fee churning, asset diversion, and workers compensation fraud. Perpetrators in the schemes can be insurance company employees or claimants. False insurance claims are insurance claims filed with the fraudulent intention towards an insurance provider.
Insurance fraud has existed since the beginning of insurance as a commercial enterprise. Fraudulent claims account for a significant portion of all claims received by insurers, and cost billions of dollars annually. Types of insurance fraud are diverse and occur in all areas of insurance.  Insurance crimes also range in severity, from slightly exaggerating claims to deliberately causing accidents or damage.  Fraudulent activities affect the lives of innocent people, both directly through accidental or intentional injury or damage, and indirectly by the crimes leading to higher insurance premiums. Insurance fraud poses a significant problem, and governments and other organizations try to deter such activity.
An epigram by the Roman poet Martial provides a clear evidence the phenomenon of insurance fraud was already known in the Roman Empire during the First Century AD:
""Tongilianus, you paid two hundred for your house;
An accident too common in this city destroyed it.
You collected ten times more. Doesn't it seem, I pray,
That you set fire to your own house, Tongilianus?"" Book III, No. Intrinsic fraud is an intentionally false representation that goes to the heart of what a given lawsuit is about, in other words, whether fraud was used to procure the transaction. (If the transaction was fraudulent, it probably does not have the legal status of a contract.) Intrinsic fraud is distinguished from extrinsic fraud (a/k/a collateral fraud) which is a deceptive means of keeping a person from discovering and/or enforcing legal rights. It is possible to have both intrinsic and extrinsic frauds.
The U.S. Supreme Court defined and distinguished intrinsic from extrinsic fraud in its unanimous  United States v. Throckmorton decision, written by Justice Samuel Freeman Miller. It described intrinsic fraud as ""any matter which was actually presented and considered in the judgment assailed"", declining to grant equitable relief to the federal government over an allegation that a settler's land claim in Mexican-ruled California had been secured two decades earlier after California became a U.S. territory through falsified documents and perjured affidavits. Even though the issue had not been raised at the original trial, the Court held that the government had had ample opportunity to exercise due diligence and investigate the evidence.During a trial, perjury, forgery, and bribery of a witness constitute frauds that might have been relieved by the court.  Such actions will usually lead to a mistrial being declared and after any penalties for the involved parties a new trial will take place on the same matter.
Two types of intrinsic fraud in contract law are fraud in the inducement and fraud in the factum.
Fraud in the factum is a legal defense, and occurs where A signs a contract, but either does not realize that it is a contract or does not understand the nature of the contract, because of some false information that B gave to A.  For example, if John tells his mother that he is taking a college course on handwriting analysis, and for his homework, he needs her to read and sign a pretend deed.  If Mom signs the deed believing what he told her, and John tries to enforce the deed, Mom can plead ""fraud in the factum.""
Fraud in the inducement is an equitable defense, and occurs when A signs a contract, knowing that it is a contract and (at least having a rough idea) what the contract is about, but the reason A signed the contract was because of some false information that B gave to A.  For example, if John tells his mother to sign a deed giving him her property, Mom refuses at first, then John explains that the deed will be kept in a safe deposit box until she dies.  If Mom signs the deed because of this statement from John, and John tries to enforce the deed prior to Mom's death, Mom can plead ""fraud in the inducement.""Securities fraud, also known as stock fraud and investment fraud, is a deceptive practice in the stock or commodities markets that induces investors to make purchase or sale decisions on the basis of false information, frequently resulting in losses, in violation of securities laws.Securities fraud can also include outright theft from investors (embezzlement by stockbrokers), stock manipulation, misstatements on a public company's financial reports, and lying to corporate auditors. The term encompasses a wide range of other actions, including insider trading, front running and other illegal acts on the trading floor of a stock or commodity exchange.Job fraud is fraudulent or deceptive activity or representation on the part of an employee or prospective employee toward an employer. It is not to be confused with employment fraud, where an employer scams job seekers or fails to pay wages for work performed. There are several types of job frauds that employees or potential employees commit against employers. While some may be illegal under jurisdictional laws, others do not violate law but may be held by the employer against the employee or applicant.A Lebanese loop is a device used to commit fraud and identity theft by exploiting automated teller machines (ATMs). In its simplest form, it is a strip or sleeve of metal or plastic which blocks the ATM's card slot, causing any inserted card to be apparently retained by the machine, allowing it to be retrieved by the fraudster when the card holder leaves.
Its name comes from its regular use amongst Lebanese financial crime perpetrators, although it has since spread to other international criminal groups. The scam has been reported in countries with high numbers of ATMs such as the UK, the United States, Germany  and France.Lip sync or lip synch (pronounced , the same as the word sink, short for lip synchronization) is a technical term for matching a speaking or singing person's lip movements with sung or spoken vocals.
Audio for lip syncing is generated through the sound reinforcement system in a live performance or via television, computer, cinema speakers, or other forms of audio output. The term can refer to any of a number of different techniques and processes, in the context of live performances and audiovisual recordings.
In film production, lip syncing is often part of the post-production phase. Dubbing foreign-language films and making animated characters appear to speak both require elaborate lip syncing. Many video games make extensive use of lip-synced sound files to create an immersive environment in which on-screen characters appear to be speaking. In the music industry, lip syncing is used by singers for music videos, television and film appearances and some types of live performances. Lip syncing by singers can be controversial to fans attending concert performances who expect to view a live performance.This is a list of controversial elections arranged by continent and date.A corporate collapse typically involves the insolvency or bankruptcy of a major business enterprise. A corporate scandal involves alleged or actual unethical behavior by people acting within or on behalf of a corporation. Many recent corporate collapses and scandals have involved false or inappropriate accounting of some sort (see list at accounting scandals).The following is an alphabetical list of notable people known to have committed fraud.In law, fraud is  an intentional deception to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right. Fraud can violate civil law or criminal law, or it may cause no loss of money, property, or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong. The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits, for example by obtaining a passport, travel document, or driver's license, or mortgage fraud, where the perpetrator may attempt to qualify for a mortgage by way of false statements. In contrast, a hoax is a distinct concept that involves deliberate deception without the intention of gain or of materially damaging or depriving a victim.A long firm fraud (also known as a consumer credit fraud) is a crime that uses a trading company set up for fraudulent purposes; the basic operation is to run the company as an apparently legitimate business by buying goods and paying suppliers promptly to secure a good credit record. Once they are sufficiently well-established, the perpetrators purchase the next round of goods on credit, then decamp with the goods and profits from previous sales. The goods can then be sold elsewhere. The procedure needs a certain amount of money to set up, often the proceeds from another crime or a previous long firm. Sometimes an individual who does time in jail for assisting the fraud is paid for the time served. Long firm frauds have become significantly less common in recent years since it is no longer possible to operate for any length of time without leaving a significant paper trail.


== References ==The Maria Duval Scam is one of the most successful mail scams in history, having defrauded millions of people out of at least $ million over twenty years. Targeting sick and elderly people through a combination of personalized letters and personal information databases, it has been shut down in the United States in , but is still ongoing in many countries.Mass-marketing fraud (or mass market fraud) is a scheme that uses mass-communication media – including telephones, the Internet, mass mailings, television, radio, and personal contact – to contact, solicit, and obtain money, funds, or other items of value from multiple victims in one or more jurisdictions. The frauds where victims part with their money by promising cash, prizes, and services and high returns on investment are part of mass market fraud.The  Medicaid fraud was a case of Medicaid fraud carried out by an Armenian-American organized crime group called the Mirzoyan–Terdjanian organization. The scam involved a crime syndicate which created  fake clinics in  states and used stolen medical license numbers of real doctors and matched them to legitimate Medicare patients whose names and billing information were also stolen. The group submitted more than $ million in claims and received $ million of that before they were caught. Prosecutors charged  individuals in several states with allegations of racketeering conspiracy, bank fraud, money laundering and identity theft.In the United States, Medicare fraud is the claiming of Medicare health care reimbursement to which the claimant is not entitled. There are many different types of Medicare fraud, all of which have the same goal: to collect money from the Medicare program illegitimately.The total amount of Medicare fraud is difficult to track, because not all fraud is detected and not all suspicious claims turn out to be fraudulent. According to the Office of Management and Budget, Medicare ""improper payments"" were $. billion in , but some of these payments later turned out to be valid. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that total Medicare spending was $ billion in .Mediumship is the practice of purportedly mediating communication between familiar spirits or spirits of the dead and living human beings.  Practitioners are known as ""mediums"" or ""spirit mediums"". There are different types of mediumship or spirit channelling, including séance tables, trance, and ouija.
Belief in psychic ability is widespread despite the absence of objective evidence for its existence. Scientific researchers have attempted to ascertain the validity of claims of mediumship. An experiment undertaken by the British Psychological Society led to the conclusion that the test subjects demonstrated no mediumistic ability.Mediumship gained popularity during the nineteenth century, when ouija boards were used as a source of entertainment. Investigations during this period revealed widespread fraud—with some practitioners employing techniques used by stage magicians—and the practice began to lose credibility. Fraud is still rife in the medium or psychic industry, with cases of deception and trickery being discovered to this day.Several different variants of mediumship have been described; arguably the best-known forms involve a spirit purportedly taking control of a medium's voice and using it to relay a message, or where the medium simply ""hears"" the message and passes it on. Other forms involve materializations of the spirit or the presence of a voice, and telekinetic activity.
The practice is associated with several religious-belief systems such as Shamanism, Vodun, Spiritualism, Spiritism, Candomblé, Voodoo, Umbanda and some New Age groups.Melanie's Marvelous Measles is a self-published children's book written by Australian author and anti-vaccine activist Stephanie Messenger. Through its story, the book claims, contrary to scientific data, that contracting measles is beneficial to health, and that vaccines are ineffective.
The book was first published in , but came to attention in  following a measles outbreak that began at Disneyland during December of the previous year. Many commentators have criticised the book because of the dangers associated with contracting measles, and because its title is reminiscent of George's Marvellous Medicine, by Roald Dahl, who was a prominent advocate of vaccination in his later years, following the death of his daughter Olivia from measles in . The book has also received attention for the numerous negative reviews it has received on Amazon.com.Misleading or deceptive conduct (often referred to as just misleading conduct) is a doctrine of Australian law.
Section  of the Australian Consumer Law, which is found in schedule  of the Competition and Consumer Act , prohibits conduct by corporations in trade or commerce which is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive. The states and territories of Australia each have Fair Trading Legislation either containing similar provisions in relation to misleading or deceptive conduct by individuals, or simply applies the federal law to the state or territory. Section DA of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission Act  prohibits misleading or deceptive conduct in financial services.The doctrine aims primarily to provide consumer protection by preventing businesses from misleading their customers. However, it extends to all situations in the course of trade or commerce. A range of remedies are available in the event of misleading or deceptive conduct.Mismarking in securities valuation takes place when the value that is assigned to securities does not reflect what the securities are actually worth, due to intentional fraudulent mispricing. Mismarking misleads investors and fund executives about how much the securities in a securities portfolio managed by a trader are worth (the securities' net asset value, or NAV), and thus misrepresents performance.  When a trader engages in mismarking, it allows him to obtain a higher bonus from the financial firm for which he works, where his bonus is calculated by the performance of the securities portfolio that he is managing.Mismarking is an element of operational risk. The trader engaging in mismarking is sometimes referred to as a ""rogue trader.""During market downturns, determining the value of illiquid securities held in portfolios becomes especially challenging, in part because of the amount of debt associated with these securities and in part because of fewer mechanisms for price discovery. As a result, during such periods illiquid securities are especially susceptible to fraudulent mismarking.Missing trader fraud (also called missing trader intra-community fraud or MTIC fraud) involves the theft of Value Added Tax (VAT) from a government by fraudsters who exploit VAT rules, most commonly the European Union VAT rules which provide that the movement of goods between member states is VAT-free. There are different variations of the fraud but they generally involve a trader charging VAT on the sale of goods and absconding with the VAT (instead of paying the VAT to the government's taxation authority). The term ""missing trader"" is used because the fraudster has gone missing with the VAT.
A common form of missing trader fraud is carousel fraud. In carousel fraud, VAT and goods are passed around between companies and jurisdictions, similar to how a carousel revolves.Mobile tower rental business offers are a new form of mass marketing fraud in India. These frauds are unique to the Indian subcontinent.
Mass-marketing fraud is defined as fraud committed via mass communication media using the telephone, mail, and the Internet.
""Mobile tower fraud"" may be defined as a type of mass marketing fraud with advance fee fraud characteristics, where the central scheme is the installation of a mobile tower in the victim's property. The victims are lured by the promise of huge rental income. Mobile tower fraudsters are targeting individuals of all ages and demographics. With the telecommunication infrastructure booming in India to meet the socioeconomic requirements of the country, mass marketing fraudsters have seen a criminal opportunity in it.A mock auction is a scam usually operated in a street market, disposal sale or similar environment, where cheap and low quality goods are sold at high prices by a team of confidence tricksters.A money mule, sometimes called a ""smurfer,"" is a person who transfers money acquired illegally (e.g., stolen) in person, through a courier service, or electronically, on behalf of others. Typically, the mule is paid for services with a small part of the money transferred. Money mules are often dupes recruited on-line for what they think is legitimate employment, not aware that the money they are transferring is the product of crime. The money is transferred from the mule's account to the scam operator, typically in another country. Similar techniques are used to transfer illegal merchandise.The Mussolini diaries are several forged diaries of Italy's former fascist leader Benito Mussolini. The two best known cases of forged Mussolini diaries are those of  and , but other forgeries have also been discovered.Overbilling (sometimes spelled as over-billing) is the practice of charging more than is legally or ethically acceptable on an invoice or bill.PAN truncation is an anti-fraud measure available on some credit-card-processing point of sale (POS) terminals as part of a merchant account service.
""PAN"" is an acronym for primary account number, i.e., the ""card number"" on either a debit or a credit card. PAN truncation simply replaces the card number printed on a customer receipt with a printout of only the last four digits, the remainder being replaced usually by asterisks. This hides the card number from anyone who obtains the receipt when discarded, or by other means, while still allowing a card holder with multiple cards to identify which was used, and thus accurately record the transaction.
PAN truncation is a measure to combat credit card fraud (and debit card fraud), which is increasing worldwide, particularly in a global market where ""card not present"" (CNP) transactions are increasingly popular over the Internet, by mail, and by telephone.The parcel mule scam, also known as the reshipping scam, involves scammers and unsuspecting victims handling goods to other countries. In some ways it is similar to the money mule scam. Scammers use fake advertising to hire mules. Items are bought with stolen cards, and since the goods are typically re-sold once shipped, this scam can be viewed as an indirect form of money laundering.A passport is a travel document issued by a government to a citizen of that country. The purpose of this document is to allow entry back into the home country, as well as access into other countries around the world by providing legal proof of identity and citizenship. Misusing a passport is a crime in many jurisdictions.Paternity fraud, also known as misattributed paternity or paternal discrepancy, occurs when a man is incorrectly identified as the biological father of a child. The underlying assumption of ""paternity fraud"" is that the mother deliberately misidentified the biological father, while ""misattributed paternity"" may be accidental. Paternity fraud is related to the historical understanding of adultery.Pèngcí (碰瓷 lit. touching or bumping porcelain) is the practice of crooks placing ostensibly expensive, fragile items (usually porcelain) in places where they may easily be knocked over, allowing them to collect damages when the items are damaged. The term has been expanded to include a predominantly Chinese crime where scammers feign injury in traffic accidents in order to extort money from drivers, as well to describe “broken porcelain” diplomacy, in which any foreign criticism of the Chinese government, or its strategic issues, is met with manufactured outrage, shattering the ""porcelain of diplomacy"" and fanning popular anger.The melon drop scam in the western world is similar to Pengci which originally targeted Japanese tourists due to the high price of watermelon in Japan. The scammer will bump or cause the mark to bump into them causing the scammer to drop a watermelon. The scammer may then receive upwards of $ for ""compensation"".Petite Mustique (also called Petit Mustique) is a small island in the Caribbean nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. About  acres ( ha) in size, Petite Mustique is located  miles (. km) northeast of Savan and  mile (. km) south of the larger island of Mustique. Petite Mustique is uninhabited and undeveloped. Sedimentary in nature, the island is hilly, reaching  ft ( m) high, and has no easy landings or large beaches. Locally, the name of the island is pronounced ""petty.""A petition mill is a fraud in which the perpetrator poses as a financial advisor, sometimes as a credit counselor or paralegal, filing hastily prepared bankruptcy documents in the name of victims who come to the advisor as clients.  The bankruptcy filing is often both incomplete and inappropriate for the victim's condition; and, often, the victim does not even realize that a bankruptcy has been filed.Pharma fraud is a term to describe several illegal activities involving the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of pharmaceuticals.Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent (e.g., spoofed, fake, or otherwise deceptive) message designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim's infrastructure like ransomware. Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and often transparently mirror the site being targeted, allowing the attacker to observe everything while the victim is navigating the site, and transverse any additional security boundaries with the victim. As of , phishing is by far the most common attack performed by cybercriminals, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Centre recording over twice as many incidents of phishing than any other type of computer crime.The first recorded use of the term ""phishing"" was in the cracking toolkit AOHell created by Koceilah Rekouche in ; however, it is possible that the term was used before this in a print edition of the hacker magazine . The word is a variant of fishing, influenced by phreaking, and alludes to the use of increasingly sophisticated lures to ""fish"" for users' sensitive information.Attempts to prevent or mitigate the impact of phishing incidents include legislation, user training, public awareness, and technical security measures. Phishing awareness has become important at home and at the work place. For instance, from  to , phishing attacks have increased from % to % among businesses.Phone cloning is the copying of identity from one cellular device to another.Phone fraud, or more generally communications fraud, is the use of telecommunications products or services with the intention of illegally acquiring money from, or failing to pay, a telecommunication company or its customers.
Many operators have increased measures to minimize fraud and reduce their losses. Communications operators tend to keep their actual loss figures and plans for corrective measures confidential.According to a  survey by CFCA, an industry group created to reduce fraud against carriers, the five top fraud loss categories reported by operators were:
US$. billion – compromised PBX/voicemail systems
$. billion – subscription/identity theft
$. billion – International Revenue Share Fraud
$. billion – by-pass fraud
$. billion – cash fraudPious fraud is used to describe fraud in religion or medicine. A pious fraud can be counterfeiting a miracle or falsely attributing a sacred text to a biblical figure due to the belief that the ""end justifies the means"", in this case the end of increasing faith by whatever means available.Plastic shaman, or plastic medicine people, is a pejorative colloquialism applied to individuals who are attempting to pass themselves off as shamans, holy people, or other traditional spiritual leaders, but who have no genuine connection to the traditions or cultures they claim to represent. In some cases, the ""plastic shaman"" may have some genuine cultural connection, but is seen to be exploiting that knowledge for ego, power, or money.Plastic shamans are believed by their critics to use the mystique of these cultural traditions, and the legitimate curiosity of sincere seekers, for their personal gain. In some cases, exploitation of students and traditional culture may involve the selling of fake ""traditional"" spiritual ceremonies, fake artifacts, fictional accounts in books, illegitimate tours of sacred sites, and often the chance to buy spiritual titles. Often Native American symbols and terms are adopted by plastic shamans, and their adherents are insufficiently familiar with Native American religion to distinguish between imitations and actual Native religion.Postage stamp reuse is the technique of fraudulently reusing postage stamps from sent mail to avoid paying the cost of postage.Provisional liquidation is a process which exists as part of the corporate insolvency laws of a number of common law jurisdictions whereby after the lodging of a petition for the winding-up of a company by the court, but before the court hears and determines the petition, the court may appoint a liquidator on a ""provisional"" basis.  (The provisional liquidator is appointed to safeguard the assets of the company and maintain the status quo pending the hearing of the petition.)  Unlike a conventional liquidator, a provisional liquidator does not assess claims against the company or try to distribute the company's assets to creditors, as the power to realise the assets comes after the court orders a liquidation.In practice most instances of applications for a provisional liquidator involve some type of allegation of fraud or other misconduct relating to the company.Quatloos.com is an anti-fraud website maintained by a non-profit corporation, Financial and Tax Fraud Education Associates, Inc. It evolved out of a basic educational website on the topic created in  by Jay Adkisson, an attorney and stockbroker, who has testified as an expert witness before the US Senate Finance Committee.Forbes selected it as one of its ""Best of The Web"" sites in . In , it was featured in PC Magazine's ""Site of the Week"" series, and was included in their  feature on the top  undiscovered web sites, where it was recommended as a good place to learn about scams and fraud. It is often cited as an authoritative source for scams in the financial media, and by government organisations, and has reportedly been frequented by employees of the US Justice and Treasury departments, as well as those of the US federal courts.In philately, a regummed stamp is any stamp without gum, or without full gum, that has had new gum applied to the back to increase its value.
Unused stamps with full original gum (OG) on the back are worth more than stamps without gum or complete gum, for instance those that have been mounted using a stamp hinge.
Until the s, it was common for stamps to be mounted using hinges and there was little difference in value between unmounted and previously hinged stamps. Since then, a significant price difference has developed between the two types of stamps and unscrupulous stamp collectors and dealers have been tempted to regum previously mounted stamps to make them appear as if they have full original gum.
Regumming may take place just to remove traces of mounting or to disguise more serious faults or repairs, in which case the whole stamp may be given new gum. Regumming to hide repaired faults is not new but regumming to remove traces of mounting is a relatively recent development.Religious fraud is a term used for civil or criminal fraud carried out in the name of a religion or within a religion, e.g. false claims to being kosher or tax fraud.A specific form of religious fraud is pious fraud (Latin: pia fraus), whereby one employs lies and/or deception in order to convince others of the truth of one's own religion or specific religious claims. Sometimes these involve 'white lies': the perpetrator may think it more important to make others accept a certain belief than that the method is truthful; this end justifies the means of a lie. A well-known example is the Shroud of Turin, a late Medieval fabrication that supposedly was the clothing in which Jesus would have been buried in the st century.There have been many instances of religious institutions carrying out fraud throughout history. The Roman Church sold indulgences to reduce the punishment an individual would face for their sins, leaders of a Florida church were convicted of investment fraud, and more recently the largest collapse of a religious financial institution in U.S. history called the Baptist Foundation of Arizona.
Law enforcement calls this affinity fraud, which means targeting victims through a common bond, religion or ethnic communities. Though religious fraud is more specified in that it only relates to affinity fraud done through the common bond of religion and that the perpetrators motivated the people of that common bond in the name of religion.. Authorities have taken multiple measures throughout history to remit this behavior. Their more current strategy relies on educating the public about the schemes used in affinity fraud cases.Claas-Hendrik Relotius (born  November ) is a German former journalist. He resigned from Der Spiegel in  after admitting numerous instances of journalistic fraud.Return fraud is the act of  defrauding a retail store by means of the return process. There are various ways in which this crime is committed. For example, the offender may return stolen merchandise to secure cash, steal receipts or receipt tape to enable a falsified return, or use somebody else's receipt to try to return an item picked up from a store shelf. Return abuse is a form of ""friendly fraud"" where someone purchases products without intending to keep them. Perhaps the best-known form of this abuse is ""wardrobing"" or ""free renting"" – in which the person makes a purchase, use the product(s), and then returns the merchandise.
The retail industry experiences a significant fraud and abuse problem, losing money in the range of $ billion per year, roughly % of all returns and exchanges.Return fraud and theft have been reported to lead to price increases for shoppers. Some stores create strict return policies such as ""no receipt, no return"" or impose return time restrictions.A romance scam is a confidence trick involving feigning romantic intentions towards a victim, gaining the victim's affection, and then using that goodwill to get the victim to send money to the scammer under false pretenses or to commit fraud against the victim.  Fraudulent acts may involve access to the victim's money, bank accounts, credit cards, passports, e-mail accounts, or national identification numbers; or forcing the victims to commit financial fraud on their behalf.These scams are often perpetrated by organized criminal gangs, who work together to take money from multiple victims at a time.More money is lost each year to romance scams than to similar internet scams, such as technical support scams.A scam letter is a document, distributed electronically or otherwise, to a recipient misrepresenting the truth with the aim of gaining an advantage in a fraudulent manner.Scams in intellectual property include scams in which inventors and other rights holders are lured to pay money for an apparently official registration of their intellectual property, or for professional development and promotion of their ideas, but do not receive the expected services.
Intellectual property (IP) is a very complex area and covers a vast range of diverse subjects. As a result, there are opportunities for unscrupulous individuals and organizations to take advantage of those wishing to secure protection for their IP.In English law, a secret profit is a profit made by an employee who uses his employer's premises and business facilities in order to engage in unauthorised trade on his own behalf. A common example is a bar manager who purchases beer from a brewery in his own right and sells it in the bar in competition with, or in preference to, that of his employer. The profit made thereby is a secret profit.Where the employee deceived a customer before  January  he could be prosecuted for obtaining property by deception, the property being the customer's money and the deception that he was selling his employer's produce. Such offences were predicated on the presumption that a customer would not purchase illicit goods were he aware of their true provenance. The offence of obtaining property by deception has since been repealed and is now replaced by the offence of fraud by false representation.The employee is a constructive trustee of the profit for the employer and the employer has proprietary interest in the profit. Hence, it is theft from the employer and the profit is not merely a civil debt owed by the employee to the employer, according to the case of FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC [] UKSC .  Where more than one person is involved there could be a conspiracy to defraud and, since the coming into force of the Fraud Act , the employee could be guilty of fraud by abuse of position.The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) is a statutory corporate fraud investigating agency in India. Initially, it was set up by a resolution adopted by the Government of India on  July  and carried out investigations within the existing legal framework under section  to  of the erstwhile Companies Act, . Later, Section  of the Companies Act, , accorded the statutory status to the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO). It is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India & primarily supervised by officers from Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service, Indian Corporate Law Service, Indian Revenue Service and other Central Services. The organisation has experts from various financial sector domains. The SFIO is mandated to conduct Multi-disciplinary investigations of major corporate frauds.It is a multi-disciplinary organization having experts from financial sector, capital market, accountancy, forensic audit, taxation, law, information technology, company law, customs and investigation. These experts have been taken from various organizations like banks, Securities and Exchange Board of India, Comptroller and Auditor General and concerned organizations and departments of the Government. Based on the recommendation of Naresh Chandra Committee on corporate governance (which was set up by the Government on  August ) and in the backdrop of stock market scams as also the failure of non-banking companies resulting in huge financial loss to the public, Vajpayee Government decided to set up SFIO on  January .A sham marriage or fake marriage is a marriage of convenience entered into without intending to create a real marital relationship. This is usually for the purpose of gaining an advantage from the marriage.
Definitions of sham marriage vary by jurisdiction, but are often related to immigration. The essential point in the varying definitions is whether the couple intend to live in a real marital relationship, to establish a life together. A typical definition by the UK Home Office in :
A sham marriage or civil partnership is one where the relationship is not genuine but one party hopes to gain an immigration advantage from it. There is no subsisting relationship, dependency, or intent to live as husband and wife or civil partners.
While referred to as a ""sham"" or ""fake"" because of its motivation, the union itself is legally valid if it conforms to the formal legal requirements for marriage in the jurisdiction. Arranging or entering into such a marriage to deceive public officials is in itself a violation of the law of some countries, for example the US.
After a period, couples often divorce if there is no purpose in remaining married. The reverse situation, in which a couple gets a divorce while continuing to live together, is called paper divorce.Shasta Regional Medical Center, formerly known as Redding Medical Center and Memorial Hospital, is a general acute care hospital that is located in Redding, California. It opened in  and currently has  beds with a basic emergency department.A shell corporation is a company or corporation that exists only on paper and has no office and no employees, but may have a bank account or may hold passive investments or be the registered owner of assets, such as intellectual property, or ships. Shell companies may be registered to the address of a company that provides a service setting up shell companies, and which may act as the agent for receipt of legal correspondence (such as an accountant or lawyer). The company may serve as a vehicle for business transactions without itself having any significant assets or operations.
Shell companies are used regularly for tax evasion, tax avoidance, money laundering, or to achieve a specific goal such as anonymity. Anonymity may be sought to shield personal assets from others, such as a spouse when a marriage is breaking down, from creditors, or from government authorities.
Shell companies can have legitimate business purposes. They may, for example, act as trustee for a trust, and not engage in any other activity on their own account. This structure creates limited liability for the trustee. A corporate shell can also be formed around a partnership to create limited liability for the partners, and other business ventures, or to immunize one part of a business from the risks of another part. Shell companies can be used to transfer assets from one company into a new one, while leaving the liabilities in the former company.A sick baby hoax is a confidence trick where a person claims, often on a website, that they have an ill child (or sometimes a cat or dog) and are struggling to pay for its medical expenses. Some versions of the hoax ask people to make a monetary donation directly, while others simply encourage people to share the story.
Professional beggars have been exploiting sick children since ancient times. The success of such scams relies on a particular compassion in people towards children. When a child is sick, this particularly touches people's hearts. An early example of this kind of hoax online is the ""sick child chain letter"", an email making the claim that ""with every name that this [letter] is sent to, the American Cancer Society will donate  cents per name to her treatment"".
Social media, such as Facebook, facilitate the following form of this scam. A photo of a sick child is posted online, commonly without knowledge of the relatives, accompanied by a heart-touching story and sometimes a request for donations, which are simply collected by the scammer. Often these photos become viral, so it becomes close to impossible to take them down. Since Facebook has been slow to address the problem efficiently (relying on user takedown requests and reports only), several scam- and hoax-combatting websites have worked together to raise the awareness of social media providers regarding this issue.Singularis Holdings Limited (in liquidation) v Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Limited [] UKSC  is a judicial decision of Supreme Court of the United Kingdom relating to the duties owed by a bank where a person acting on behalf of a corporate customer of the bank directs the bank to transfer money out of the company's account as part of a fraudulent scheme.The principal issues in the case were whether the bank had breached its duty to its customer by transferring the monies despite the suspicious circumstances surrounding the transfer request, and if so, whether the claim of the customer against the bank was precluded by the fact that the fraudulent acts of the director should be attributed to the customer so as to bar the claim of the customer against the bank.  The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal, which had held that on the facts that the bank had breached the duty to their customer, and the fact that the fraud was perpetrated by a director of the corporate customer did not preclude the claim by that corporate customer against the bank.
Practical Law reported that this is the first decision where a bank in the United Kingdom had ever been held to be liable for breaching their duty to scrutinise customer transactions for possible fraud.Sink testing is a form of medical laboratory diagnostics healthcare fraud whereby clinical specimens are discarded, via a sink drain, and fabricated results are reported, without the clinical specimen actually being tested.In the United States, the prevalence of sink testing laboratories in the s led in part to regulation following the passage of Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments in .While the illegal practice still does occur, it is rare within the highly regulated US lab market.

The cars generally suffer little damage in relation to the large demand that is then fraudulently submitted. In , a group of seven people in North and South Carolina were arrested for allegedly stealing over $, through staged crash schemes.According to the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, staged car crashes are a growing criminal problem.A statute of frauds is a form of statute requiring that certain kinds of contracts be memorialized in writing, signed by the party against whom they are to be enforced, with sufficient content to evidence the contract.A sucker list is a list of people who have previously fallen for a scam such as a telemarketing fraud, lottery scam, high-yield investment program, get-rich-quick scheme, or work-at-home schemes, or, as used by charities, someone who made a donation. The lists are usually sold to scammers or charities.After the list is sold, the victims may be called by scammers promising to recover the money they lost or the prize or merchandise they never received, in an advance-fee scam.An early example of sucker lists is mentioned an  November  article in Time which described a list of people who contributed to a lobbyist fund.Yet another usage was described in the movie Sucker List, a part of the  United States series Crime Does Not Pay. The subject of the movie are fraudulent racetrack touts, who, in particular, used to call people known to be in deep debt and give them false tips.The Tainan fake panda incident refers to an incident at a private zoo in Tainan, Taiwan, where a sun bear was painted black and white and falsely presented to visitors as a giant panda.  The bear was first unveiled on  December , and quickly drew scepticism as experts were not in power, suspecting fraud.  By  January , officials from the Council of Agriculture, and zoology experts from National Taiwan University and Normal University determined the animal was not a true panda.This incident made popular the use of the term ""(giant) cat bear"" [(dà)māoxióng, (大)貓熊] instead of ""(giant) bear cat"" [(dà)xióngmāo, (大)熊貓] to refer to pandas in Taiwan.


== References ==Telemarketing fraud is fraudulent selling conducted over the telephone. The term is also used for telephone fraud not involving selling.
Telemarketing fraud is one of the most persuasive deceptions identified by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Telemarketing fraud often involves some sort of victim compliance whether it involves the victim initiating contact with the perpetrator or voluntarily providing their private information to the offender; thus, fraud victims may experience feelings of shame and embarrassment that may prevent them from reporting their victimization.Older people are disproportionately targeted by fraudulent telemarketers and make up % of victims affected by telemarketing scams alone. Older people may be targeted more because the scammer assumes they may be more trusting, too polite to hang up, or have a nest egg. Many of older people usually have large amount of money to invest and desire of receiving unexpected profit from the investing. Also, they are less likely to report the fraud because they don't believe that consumer complaints would be solved.Area codes , , and  are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the Dominican Republic. As all NANP members, the Dominican Republic uses country code , and has similar dialing procedures for dialing the ten-digit national telephone numbers, which consist of the area code, a three-digit central office code, and a four-digit line number. The three area codes of the country are organized as an overlay plan for a single numbering plan area (NPA), comprising the entire country. Thus, ten-digit dialing is mandatory.Trusona is an American company based in Scottsdale, Arizona, that specializes in identity theft protection and created a personal authentication technology for the FBI.Trusona's founder and CEO is Ori Eisen. According to Eisen, “All of the companies we work with are Fortune  companies or government agencies”.Microsoft Ventures and the existing investor, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, joined in a $ million round of financing for Trusona to rethink the traditional password. On May , , Trusona announced support for passwordless entry on Salesforce.com.Tunneling or tunnelling is financial fraud committed by ""the transfer of assets and profits out of firms for the benefit of those who control them"". In legal terms, this is known as a fraudulent transfer, such as when a group of major shareholders or the management of a publicly-traded company orders that company to sell off its assets to a second company at unreasonably low prices. The shareholders or management typically own the second company outright, and thus profit from the otherwise disastrous sale. Tunneling differs from outright theft because people who engage in tunneling generally comply with all of the relevant legal procedures; it is thus a subtler scheme than simply writing checks from a company to a private bank account. While people widely agree that tunneling is unethical, penalties for it vary widely; some states impose criminal sanctions, whereas other states provide either for civil suits only, or for no sanctions at all.Unconscious fraud is fraud committed by somebody who does not consciously realise that they are deceiving others. Examples could be a hypnotised person or perhaps a medium in a trance, neither of whom would consciously realise that they are engaging in acts which make others believe - such as that a 'spirit' has moved an object.Utility scams are fraudulent acts where a perpetrator calls or arrives unannounced at a utility customer's house in an attempt to take money or sell unnecessary energy accessories through misrepresentation. Often, the fraud involves telling the victim that he or she owes the utility company money and that their power, gas, or water will be shut off immediately unless payment is made.Visa fraud has different criteria in various parts of the world but the commonly accepted points are the sale, provision, or transfer of otherwise legitimate visas, misrepresentation of reasons for traveling and forgery or alteration of a visa.
The United States reports that most cases of visa fraud are related to immigrants lying about their situation to seek refuge in the country, though smuggling and terrorism are also both key factors in the crime.
In the United States, visa fraud can be prosecuted under several statutes, including;

 USC   Fraud and Misuse of Visas, Permits, and Other Documents
 USC  False Statements or Entries Generally
 USC  Fraud in Connection with Identification DocumentsIt is a federal offense subject to harsh sentencing, though mitigating factors are often taken into account in the case of potential immigrants.  The maximum penalties faced by fraudsters are recounted below.

 years for a first offense not tied to terrorism or drug trafficking
 years for fraud with other criminal links
 years for fraud related to drug trafficking
 years for fraud related to international terrorismVoice phishing, or vishing, is the use of telephony (often Voice over IP telephony) to conduct phishing attacks.
Landline telephone services have traditionally been trustworthy; terminated in physical locations known to the telephone company, and associated with a bill-payer. Now however, vishing fraudsters often use modern Voice over IP (VoIP) features such as caller ID spoofing and automated systems (IVR) to impede detection by law enforcement agencies. Voice phishing is typically used to steal credit card numbers or other information used in identity theft schemes from individuals.
Usually, voice phishing attacks are conducted using automated text-to-speech systems that direct a victim to call a number controlled by the attacker, however some use live callers. Posing as an employee of a legitimate body such as the bank, police, telephone or internet provider, the fraudster attempts to obtain personal details and financial information regarding credit card, bank accounts (e.g. the PIN), as well as personal information of the victim. With the received information, the fraudster might be able to access and empty the account or commit identity fraud. Some fraudsters may also try to persuade the victim to transfer money to another bank account or withdraw cash to be given to them directly. Callers also often pose as law enforcement or as an Internal Revenue Service employee. Scammers often target immigrants and the elderly, who are coerced to wire hundreds to thousands of dollars in response to threats of arrest or deportation.Bank account data is not the only sensitive information being targeted. Fraudsters sometimes also try to obtain security credentials from consumers who use Microsoft or Apple products by spoofing the caller ID of Microsoft or Apple Inc.
Audio deepfakes have been used to commit fraud, by fooling people into thinking they are receiving instructions from a trusted individual.Vomit fraud is a type of fraud in which a driver of a vehicle for hire falsely claims that an ""incident requiring cleanup"" occurred while a passenger was riding in the driver's vehicle. The company then charges the passenger a ""cleanup fee"" to reimburse the driver for having to clean the vehicle.A warehouse bank account is a bank account at a regular commercial bank in which all clients’  funds are commingled or pooled, for the purpose of concealing the client's ownership of the funds.Welfare fraud is the act of illegally using state welfare systems by knowingly withholding or giving information to obtain more funds than would otherwise be allocated.
This article deals with welfare fraud in various countries of the world, and includes many social benefit programs such as food assistance, housing, unemployment benefits, Social Security, disability, and medical. Each country's problems and programs are varied. 
Obtaining reliable evidence of welfare fraud is notoriously difficult. Apart from the obvious methodological problems, research reveals that interviewing performance is often mediocre, and may be anecdotal, misunderstood, or collected from opinionated or biased caseworkers. Interviews with non-citizen welfare recipients, where the interviewer has succeeded in gaining a high level of trust, have shown that a very high percent fail to report incomes. Official figures of the prevalence of welfare fraud based on government investigation tend to be low – a few percent of the total amount of welfare spending. Statistical research indicates that the vast majority of fraud is committed by businesses serving the recipients of government benefits. Welfare or benefits fraud committed by recipients is usually of very modest sums, and is committed by people who struggle with poverty; but once started it often continues after reaching financial stability.Wine fraud  relates to the commercial aspects of wine. The most prevalent type of fraud is one where wines are adulterated, usually with the addition of cheaper products (e.g. juices) and sometimes with harmful chemicals and sweeteners (compensating for color or flavor).Counterfeiting and the relabelling of inferior and cheaper wines to more expensive brands is another common type of wine fraud.A third category of wine fraud relates to the investment wine industry. An example of this is when wines are offered to investors at excessively high prices by a company who then go into planned liquidation. In some cases the wine is never bought for the investor. Losses in the UK have been high, prompting the Department of Trade and Industry and Police to act. In the US, investors have been duped by fraudulent investment wine firms. Independent guidelines to potential wine investors are now available.In wine production, as wine is technically defined as fermented grape juice, the term ""wine fraud"" can be used to describe the adulteration of wine by substances that are not related to grapes. In the retailing of wine, as wine is comparable with any other commodity, the term ""wine fraud"" can be used to describe the mis-selling of wine (either as an investment or in its deceitful misrepresentation) in general.
Fraud in wine production refers to the use of additives in order to deceive. This may include coloring agents such as elderberry juice, and flavorings such as cinnamon at best, or less desirable additives at worst. Some varieties of wine have sought after characteristics. For example some wines have a deep, dark color and flavor notes of spices due to the presence of various phenolic compounds found in the skin of the grapes. Fraudsters will use additives to artificially create these characteristics when they are lacking. Fraud in the selling of wine has seen much attention focused on label fraud and the investment wine market. Counterfeit labelling of rare, expensive, and cult wines, and unregulated investment wine firms characterise this type of fraud. Wine Spectator noted as much as % of the wine sold in secondary markets could be counterfeit and the DTI (UK) believes losses by investors to rogue wine investment firms amount to hundreds of millions of pounds.Workers Resistance (Ukrainian: Robitnichi Sprotiv) was a Trotskyist political party in Ukraine.

3,social issues,"A social issue is a problem that affects many people within a society. It is a group of common problems in present-day society and ones that many people strive to solve. It is often the consequence of factors extending beyond an individual's control. Social issues are the source of conflicting opinions on the grounds of what is perceived as morally correct or incorrect personal life or interpersonal social life decisions. Social issues are distinguished from economic issues; however, some issues (such as immigration) have both social and economic aspects. Some issues do not fall into either category, such as warfare.
There can be disagreements about what social issues are worth solving, or which should take precedence. Different individuals and different societies have different perceptions. In Rights of Man and Common Sense, Thomas Paine addresses the individual's duty to ""allow the same rights to others as we allow ourselves."" The failure to do so causes the creation of a social issue.
There are a variety of methods people use to combat social issues. Some people vote for leaders in a democracy to advance their ideals. Outside the political process, people donate or share their time, money, energy, or other resources. This often takes the form of volunteering. Nonprofit organizations are often formed for the sole purpose of solving a social issue. Community organizing involves gathering people together for a common purpose.
A distinct but related meaning of the term ""social issue"" (used particularly in the United States) refers to topics of national political interest, over which the public is deeply divided and which are the subject of intense partisan advocacy, debate, and voting. In this case ""social issue"" does not necessarily refer to an ill to be solved, but rather a topic to be discussed.Cambridge Documentary Films is a non profit organization established in Massachusetts in .  The purpose of the organization is to create new perspectives on important social issues and give voice to groups and individuals whose perspectives are ignored by mainstream media. Cambridge Documentary Films produces and distributes award-winning documentaries to thousands of universities, community organizations, schools, libraries and public interest organizations throughout the United States and the world. These films have won numerous awards, including an Academy Award  and have been screened at the UN General Assembly, The White House, the Office of the Vice President, the US Congress and numerous state houses. The subjects include: advertising's image of women, domestic violence, trauma, rape, eating disorders, self-esteem, media literacy, homophobia, the labor movement, gender roles, career counseling, nuclear war, reproductive health hazards, the women's health movement, gay and lesbian parenting and other social issues.The Centre for Social Investigation (CSI) is an interdisciplinary research group based at Nuffield College, Oxford University, in England.
The CSI is led by Professor Anthony Heath, CBE, FBA, Emeritus Professor of Sociology at Oxford University and Professor of Sociology at The University of Manchester. It was launched officially in March . The Centre aims to address contemporary social issues of public interest, carrying out authoritative, research on central social issues which draws upon interdisciplinary expertise  in economics, politics and sociology and related disciplines such as social policy. A particular focus is on examining social progress in Britain and to this aim, the Centre has undertaken research covering topics including crime, education, social capital, life expectancy, corruption, food insecurity and Beveridge’s ‘five giants’. The Centre also undertakes research on inequalities, including those relating to gender, ethnicity  and class. The Centre has a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary work and rigorous methods, ranging from quantitative research to field experiments. It has undertaken collaborative work with the UK Department for Communities and Local Government.CSI's research is independent and non-partisan; as such, it has no political affiliation or leaning. The Centre is counselled by an advisory board whose members work in research, policy and the private sector. Unusually for an academic research group, the Centre has a strong emphasis on engaging and disseminating its research beyond traditional academic outputs to communicate the results of its activities in an accessible way to non-technical audiences, including policy-makers and the public more generally. The Centre maintains a blog with posts from both its researchers and from guest contributors.Concentrated poverty concerns the spatial distribution of socio-economic deprivation, specifically focusing on the density of poor populations. Within the United States, common usage of the term concentrated poverty is observed in the fields of policy and scholarship referencing areas of ""extreme"" or ""high-poverty."" These are defined by the US census as areas where "" percent of the tract population [lives] below the federal poverty threshold."" A large body of literature argues that areas of concentrated poverty place additional burdens on poor families residing within them, burdens beyond what these families' individual circumstances would dictate.  Research also indicates that areas of concentrated poverty can have effects beyond the neighborhood in question, affecting surrounding neighborhoods not classified as ""high-poverty"" and subsequently limiting their overall economic potential and social cohesion. Concentrated poverty is a global phenomenon, with prominent examples world-wide. Despite differing definitions, contributing factors, and overall effects, global concentrated poverty retains its central theme of spatial density. Multiple programs have attempted to ameliorate concentrated poverty and its effects within the United States, with varying degrees of progress and to sometimes detrimental effect.The Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential is published by the Union of International Associations (UIA). It is available online since , and was previously available as a CD-ROM and as a three-volume book.The Encyclopedia was started under the direction of Anthony Judge in  and now comprises more than , entries and , links, as well as hundreds of pages of introductory notes and commentaries. The Encyclopedia collects information on problems, strategies, values, concepts of human development, and various intellectual resources.Epochalism is an attitude of respect for the progressive spirit of the age and for social and technological advancement, which was contrasted by Clifford Geertz with what he termed the (essentialist) valorisation of traditional values. He viewed this distinction as a central social polarity pervading developing nations.More broadly, the term used has been used to describe the post-Fordist, postmodern belief that the current era or epoch represents a fundamental clean break with the past; is something unique in human history; and due to this radical change, previous rules will no longer apply.On  February , at around : pm, a group of intoxicated men entered the campus of Gargi College, a women's college affiliated to University of Delhi. The incidents happened during the annual cultural fest of the college, Reverie. Reportedly, some students were sexually assaulted by members of the mob. It was also reported that some of the men masturbated in front of the female students.An FIR was registered by the principal of Gargi College three days later. A fact-finding committee was created by the college administration to gather relevant information on the incidents.The Delhi Police said an inspector of Crime Against Women (CAW) Cell was designated as the investigation officer in the case and the Additional DCP of South Delhi was designated as the inquiry officer. Police arrested  suspects on  February , and two more  February . Police later arrested five more suspects, bringing the number of arrests to seventeen as of  February . On  February , the initial ten accused were released on bail.Incel ( IN-sel; an abbreviation of ""involuntary celibate""), or sometimes incels, is an ideology, an online subculture, an identity, an online community, and/or a movement characterized by public displays of sexual and/or romantic frustration. Some discussions in incel forums are characterized by hatred, misogyny, misanthropy, self-pity and self-loathing, racism, a sense of entitlement to sex, and the endorsement of violence against women and sexually active people. During , the American Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) described the incel community as ""part of the online male supremacist ecosystem"" that is included in their list of hate groups.'An incel' or 'incels' also often refers to those who engage in ideology, subculture, communities, identity, and/or movements labeled 'incel' by mainstream media. Incels have been described as mostly male, mostly white, and mostly heterosexual.Since , multiple mass killings have been perpetrated by self-identified incels, as well as other instances of violence or attempted violence. After the  Toronto van attack, incel communities have been repeatedly criticized by researchers and the media for being misogynistic, encouraging violence, spreading extremist views, and radicalizing their members. A statistical analysis of the largest incel forum shows  forum accounts made % of all forum posts during all of  and most of .Social nudity is the practice of nudity in relatively public settings not restricted by gender. This occurs both in public spaces and on commercial property, such as at a naturist resort.
Some isolated indigenous nudity still exists in the tropics, though this way of life is highly endangered, as is male nude swimming in public, which used to be very commonplace in Western civilization. Modern European-style naturism began around the turn of the th century in British India and Northern Germany, and it was brought to the United States by German immigrants in the s.Loneliness is an unpleasant emotional response to perceived isolation. Loneliness is also described as social pain – a psychological mechanism which motivates individuals to seek social connections. It is often associated with an unwanted lack of connection and intimacy. Loneliness overlaps and yet is distinct from solitude. Solitude is simply the state of being apart from others; not everyone who experiences solitude feels lonely. As a subjective emotion, loneliness can be felt even when a person is surrounded by other people.
The causes of loneliness are varied. Loneliness can be a result of genetic inheritance, cultural factors, a lack of meaningful relationships, a significant loss, an excessive reliance on passive technologies (notably the Internet in the st century), or a self-perpetuating mindset. Research has shown that loneliness is found throughout society, including among people in marriages along with other strong relationships, and those with successful careers. Most people experience loneliness at some points in their lives, and some feel it often. The effects of loneliness are also varied. Transient loneliness (loneliness which exists for a short period of time) is related to positive effects, including an increased focus on the strength of one's relationships. Chronic loneliness (loneliness which exists for a significant amount of time in one's life) is generally correlated with negative effects, including increased obesity, substance use disorder, risk of depression, cardiovascular disease, risk of high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Chronic loneliness is also correlated with an increased risk of death and suicidal thoughts.
Medical treatments for loneliness include beginning therapy and taking antidepressants. Social treatments for loneliness generally include an increase in interaction with others, such as group activities (such as exercise or religious activities), re-engaging with old friends or colleagues, and becoming more connected with one's community. Other social treatments for loneliness include the ownership of pets and loneliness-designed technologies, such as meetup services or social robots (although the use of some technologies in order to combat loneliness is debated).
Loneliness has long been a theme in literature, going back to the Epic of Gilgamesh. However, academic coverage of loneliness was sparse until recent decades. In the st century, some academics and professionals have claimed that loneliness has become an epidemic, including Vivek Murthy, the Surgeon General of the United States. However, this claim has been disputed, with critics arguing that loneliness has not increased, but rather only academic focus on the topic has.The manosphere is a collection of websites, blogs, and online forums promoting masculinity, misogyny, and opposition to feminism. Communities within the manosphere include men's rights activists, incels (involuntary celibates), Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW), pick-up artists (PUA), and fathers' rights groups.The manosphere overlaps with the far-right and alt-right communities. It has also been associated with online harassment and has been implicated in radicalizing men into misogynist beliefs and the glorification of violence against women. Some sources have associated manosphere-based radicalization with mass shootings motivated by misogyny.Martine-Anstett Award, or Martine-Anstett Human Rights Prize, is awarded every year on  April in Paris to the person, man or woman, strongly committed to the defense of human rights.  April is the anniversary of the day Martine Anstett died. Martine Anstett Human Rights Award is also to protect the rights of migrants.This annual prize is worth  Euros.Meanness is a personal quality whose classical form, discussed by many from Aristotle to Thomas Aquinas, characterizes it as a vice of ""lowness"", but whose modern form deals more with cruelty.Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW ) is an anti-feminist, misogynistic, mostly-online community advocating for men to separate themselves from women and from a society which they believe has been corrupted by feminism. The community is a part of the manosphere, a collection of anti-feminist websites and online communities that also includes the men's rights movement, incels, and pickup artists.Like other manosphere communities, MGTOW overlaps with the alt-right and white supremacist movements, and it has been implicated in online harassment of women. The Southern Poverty Law Center categorizes MGTOW as a part of the male supremacist ideology.Museums and Digital Culture (), edited by Tula Giannini and Jonathan P. Bowen, who are also the authors of  chapters, is an interdisciplinary book about developments in digital culture with respect to museums.The term Nature-based solutions (NBS) refers to the sustainable management and use of natural features and processes to tackle socio-environmental challenges. These challenges include issues such as climate change, water security, water pollution, food security, human health, biodiversity loss, and disaster risk management.
The European Commission's definition of NBS states that these solutions are ""inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes, and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions"". In , the EC definition was updated to further emphasise that “Nature-based solutions must benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosystem services.” Through the use of NBS healthy, resilient, and diverse ecosystems (whether natural, managed, or newly created) can provide solutions for the benefit of both societies and overall biodiversity. Research and Innovation projects on NBS funded by the EU Framework Programme are required to respond to this definition.The Nature-based Solutions Initiative, meanwhile, defines NBS as ""actions that work with and enhance nature so as to help people adapt to change and disasters"".
For instance, the restoration and/or protection of mangroves along coastlines utilizes a Nature-based solution to accomplish several goals. Mangroves moderate the impact of waves and wind on coastal settlements or cities and sequester CO. They also provide nursery zones for marine life that can be the basis for sustaining fisheries on which local populations may depend. Additionally, mangrove forests can help to control coastal erosion resulting from sea level rise. Similarly, green roofs or walls are Nature-based solutions that can be implemented in cities to moderate the impact of high temperatures, capture storm water, abate pollution, and act as carbon sinks, while simultaneously enhancing biodiversity.
Conservation approaches and environmental management initiatives have been carried out for decades. More recently, progress has been made in better articulating the benefits Nature-based solutions can provide for human well-being. Even if the framing of the term itself continues to evolve, examples of Nature-based solutions can already be found all over the world.
Recent studies have proposed ways of planning and implementing Nature-based solutions in urban areas, while NBS are increasingly being incorporated into mainstream national and international policies and programmes (e.g. climate change policy, law, infrastructure investment, and financing mechanisms), with increasing attention being given to NBS by the European Commission since , as an integral part of the EU's Research & Innovation policy. The UN has also tried to promote a shift in perspective towards NBS: the theme for World Water Day  was ""Nature for Water"", while UN-Water's accompanying UN World Water Development Report was titled ""Nature-based Solutions for Water"". The  UN Climate Action Summit, meanwhile, highlighted Nature-based solutions as an effective method to combat climate change and a ""Nature Based Solution Coalition"" was created, including dozens of countries, led by China and New Zealand.New World Syndrome is a set of non-communicable diseases brought on by consumption of junk food and a sedentary lifestyle, especially common to indigenous peoples of the Americas, Oceania, and circumpolar peoples. It is characterized by obesity, heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and shortened life span.Safe parking lots are parking lots in the United States in which homeless people can park their cars and safely sleep at night. Some hire private security guards to make the facility more safe.The Seattle Freeze is, according to widely held belief, a difficulty with making new friends  in the U.S. city of Seattle, Washington, particularly for transplants from other areas. A  article in The Seattle Times appears to be the first known use of the term, although the phenomenon was documented during rapid population increases in the early s, World War II, and the s.Social advertising is the use of advertising to inform the public about a social issue or to influence their behavior.While social advertising campaigns are often successful in raising awareness, they are typically unsuccessful in producing long-term behavior change of the type that can be achieved through the use of social marketing. Social advertising may, however, form a part of a social marketing intervention.Social advertising makes people understand what the government does.Social innovations are new social practices that aim to meet social needs in a better way than the existing solutions, resulting from - for example - working conditions, education, community development or health. These ideas are created with the goal of extending and strengthening civil society. Social innovation includes the social processes of innovation, such as open source methods and techniques and also the innovations which have a social purpose—like activism, virtual volunteering, microcredit, or distance learning. There are many definitions of social innovation, however, they usually include the broad criteria about social objectives, social interaction between actors or actor diversity, social outputs, and innovativeness (The innovation should be at least ”new” to the beneficiaries it targets, but it does not have to be new to the world). Different definitions include different combinations and different number of these criteria (e.g. EU is using definition stressing out social objectives and actors interaction). Transformative social innovation not only introduces new approaches to seemingly intractable problems, but is successful in changing the social institutions that created the problem in the first place.According to Herrero de Egaña B., social innovation is defined as ""new or novel ways that society has to deal with Relevant Social Challenges (RSCh), that are more effective, efficient and sustainable or that generate greater impact than the previous ones and that contribute to making it stronger and more articulated"".Prominent innovators associated with the term include Pakistani Akhter Hameed Khan, Bangladeshi Muhammad Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank which pioneered the concept of microcredit for supporting innovations in many developing countries such as Asia, Africa and Latin America, and inspired programs like the Jindal Centre for Social Innovation & Entrepreneurship and Infolady Social Entrepreneurship Programme of Dnet (A Social Enterprise).Like many other communities, the older Chinatowns face certain social problems. Although Chinatowns are now generally viewed and valued as tourist attractions, their earlier reputation was that of dangerous or dilapidated ghettos and slums, sites of brothels, opium dens, and gambling halls.A social problem film is a narrative film that integrates a larger social conflict into the individual conflict between its characters. In the context of the United States and of Hollywood, the genre is defined by fictionalized depictions of social crises set in realistic American domestic or institutionalized settings.Like many film genres, the exact definition is often in the eye of the beholder; however, Hollywood did produce and market a number of topical films in the s, and by the s, the term ""social problem"" film, or ""message"" film, was conventional in its usage among the film industry and the public.Many characteristics that have grown to define the social problem film revolve around the perceived consciousness of the nation about a certain social issue and integrating that issue into a narrative structure. Social problems such as the horrors of war, suffering of the poor, addiction, the rights of women, and the inhumanity of a certain world are often put on display. The problem with defining this type of film as a genre lies within the ability it has to separate itself from films that display similar style, as a lot of films do address social issues. However, the social problem film differentiates itself by focusing on the problems within the historical context of the current time, dealing with the social issue of a certain era as it applies to that era with a style that is much more didactic than its contemporaries. Furthermore, the social problem film allows further immersion into a certain issue than other genre films. For instance, gangster and prison films will reflect certain features of a social issue but won't actually fully explore the problem in the way that would qualify it for this genre.Social stress is stress that stems from one's relationships with others and from the social environment in general. Based on the appraisal theory of emotion, stress arises when a person evaluates a situation as personally relevant and perceives that they do not have the resources to cope or handle the specific situation.  The activation of social stress does not necessarily have to occur linked to a specific event, the mere idea that the event may occur could trigger it. This means that any element that takes a subject out of their personal and intimate environment could become a stressful experience. Situation that makes them socially incompetent individuals.There are three main categories of social stressors. Life events are defined as abrupt, severe life changes that require an individual to adapt quickly (ex. sexual assault, sudden injury). Chronic strains are defined as persistent events which require an individual to make adaptations over an extended period of time (ex. divorce, unemployment). Daily hassles are defined as minor events that occur, which require adaptation throughout the day (ex. bad traffic, disagreements).  When stress becomes chronic, one experiences emotional, behavioral, and physiological changes that can put one under greater risk for developing a mental disorder and physical illness.Humans are social beings by nature, as they typically have a fundamental need and desire to maintain positive social relationships. Thus, they usually find maintaining positive social ties to be beneficial. Social relationships can offer nurturance, foster feelings of social inclusion, and lead to reproductive success. Anything that disrupts or threatens to disrupt their relationships with others can result in social stress. This can include low social status in society or in particular groups, giving a speech, interviewing with potential employers, caring for a child or spouse with a chronic illness, meeting new people at a party, the threat of or actual death of a loved one, divorce, and discrimination. Social stress can arise from one's micro-environment (e.g., family ties) and macro-environment (e.g., hierarchical societal structure). Social stress is typically the most frequent type of stressor that people experience in their daily lives and affects people more intensely than other types of stressors.The Society for the Study of Social Problems  (SSSP) is an organization founded in  in counterpoint to the American Sociological Association.Suffering, or pain in a broad sense, may be an experience of unpleasantness or aversion, possibly associated with the perception of harm or threat of harm in an individual. Suffering is the basic element that makes up the negative valence of affective phenomena. The opposite of suffering is pleasure or happiness.
Suffering is often categorized as physical or mental. It may come in all degrees of intensity, from mild to intolerable. Factors of duration and frequency of occurrence usually compound that of intensity. Attitudes toward suffering may vary widely, in the sufferer or other people, according to how much it is regarded as avoidable or unavoidable, useful or useless, deserved or undeserved.
Suffering occurs in the lives of sentient beings in numerous manners, often dramatically. As a result, many fields of human activity are concerned with some aspects of suffering. These aspects may include the nature of suffering, its processes, its origin and causes, its meaning and significance, its related personal, social, and cultural behaviors, its remedies, management, and uses.Zemiology is the study of social harms. Zemiology gets its name from the Greek word ζημία zēmía, meaning ""harm"".
It originated as a critique of criminology and the notion of crime. In contrast with ""individual-based harms"" such as theft, the notion of social harm or social injury incorporates harms caused by nation states and corporations. These ideas have received increased attention from critical academics such as neo-Marxists and feminists who have sought to create an independent field of study, separate from criminology, that studies the harms that affect individuals' lives that are not considered to be criminal or are rarely criminalised such as mortgage misselling, poverty and unemployment."
4,labour law,"Labour laws (also known as labor laws or employment laws) are those that mediate the relationship between workers, employing entities, trade unions, and the government. Collective labour law relates to the tripartite relationship between employee, employer, and union. 
Individual labour law concerns employees' rights at work also through the contract for work. Employment standards are social norms (in some cases also technical standards) for the minimum socially acceptable conditions under which employees or contractors are allowed to work. Government agencies (such as the former US Employment Standards Administration) enforce labour law (legislature, regulatory, or judicial).In some jurisdictions, holiday pay is an allowance which an employee earns through work in the calendar year prior to the year of the holiday. It is usually a percentage supplement to the salary that has been paid the year before the holiday pay is to be paid.
Holiday pay is a legal term in Norway (feriepenger), Sweden (semesterlön), Denmark (feriepenge), Belgium and the Netherlands (vakantiegeld, pécule de vacances), Germany and Austria (Urlaubsgeld).In the majority of nations, including all industrialised nations except the United States, advances in employee relations have seen the introduction of statutory agreements for minimum employee leave from work—that is the amount of entitlement to paid vacation and public holidays. Companies may offer contractually more time. Companies and the law may also differ as to whether public holidays are counted as part of the minimum leave.
Disparities in national minimums are still subject of debate regarding work-life balance and perceived differences between nations. These numbers usually refer to full-time employment – part-time workers may get a reduced number of days. In most countries, public holidays are paid and usually not considered part of the annual leave. Also, in most countries there are additional paid leave benefits such as parental leave and sick leave that are not listed here.The  Labour Code is a Sudanese law regulating employment. It replaced the Manpower Act of .It sets forth the organization of employment (including provisions for women and juveniles), contracts of service, wages, working hours and leave, termination of employment, after-service benefits, and miscellaneous other provisions. It also lists categories of persons who are exempt from the act, among them domestic servants, agricultural workers other than persons employed in establishments that process agricultural products, and casual workers.The Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh (the Accord) was signed on  April . It is a five-year independent, legally binding Global Framework Agreement between global brands, retailers and trade unions designed to build a safe and healthy Bangladeshi Ready Made Garment (RMG) Industry. The agreement was created in the immediate aftermath of the Rana Plaza building collapse that led to the death of more than  people and injured more than . In June , an implementation plan was agreed leading to the incorporation of the Bangladesh Accord Foundation in the Netherlands in October .
The agreement consists of six key components:

A five-year legally binding agreement between brands and trade unions to ensure a safe working environment in the Bangladeshi RMG industry
An independent inspection program supported by brands in which workers and trade unions are involved
Public disclosure of all factories, inspection reports and corrective action plans (CAP)
A commitment by signatory brands to ensure sufficient funds are available for remediation and to maintain sourcing relationships
Democratically elected health and safety committees in all factories to identify and act on health and safety risks
Worker empowerment through an extensive training program, complaints mechanism and right to refuse unsafe work.The agreement is an example of project-oriented multistakeholder governance.Agency worker law refers to a body of law which regulates the conduct of employment agencies and the labour law rights of people who get jobs through them. The typical situation involves the person going to an employment agency and then the employment agency sending the person to an actual employer for proper work.Annual leave is a period of paid time off work granted by employers to employees to be used for whatever the employee wishes. Depending on the employer's policies, differing number of days may be offered, and the employee may be required to give a certain amount of advance notice, may have to coordinate with the employer to be sure that staffing is the employee's absence, and other requirements may have to be met. The vast majority of countries today mandate a minimum amount of paid annual leave by law.Among the larger countries, China requires at least five days' paid annual leave and India requires two days of paid leave for every month worked. The United States mandates no minimum paid leave, treating it as a perk rather than a right.Anti-sweatshop movement refers to campaigns to improve the conditions of workers in sweatshops, i.e. manufacturing places characterized by low wages, poor working conditions and often child labor. It started in the th century in industrialized countries such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom to improve the conditions of workers in those countries.A banishment room (also known as a chasing-out-room and a boredom room) is a modern employee exit management strategy whereby employees are transferred to another department where they are assigned meaningless work until they become disheartened and resign.  Since the resignation is voluntary, the employee would not be eligible for certain benefits. The legality and ethicality of the practice is questionable and may be construed as constructive dismissal in some regions.
The practice, which is not officially acknowledged, is common in Japan which has strong labor laws and a tradition of permanent employment. In France, the expression ""mise au placard"" describes this due to the difficulty of firing employees (outside of mergers)Bharat Forge Co Ltd v Uttam Manohar Nakate [] INSC  is an Indian labour law case concerning the dismissal of a worker who was found to be asleep in . After  years, the Supreme Court of India upheld his dismissal.Union Royale Belge des Sociétés de Football Association ASBL v Jean-Marc Bosman () C-/ (known as the Bosman ruling) is a   European Court of Justice decision concerning freedom of movement for workers, freedom of association, and direct effect of article  (now article  of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) of the TEC. The case was an important decision on the free movement of labour and had a profound effect on the transfers of footballers—and by extension players of other professional sports—within the European Union (EU).
The decision banned restrictions on foreign EU players within national leagues and allowed players in the EU to move to another club at the end of a contract without a transfer fee being paid.
The ruling was made in a consolidation of three separate legal cases, all involving Belgian player Jean-Marc Bosman:

Belgian Football Association v Jean-Marc Bosman
R.F.C. de Liège v Jean-Marc Bosman and others
UEFA v Jean-Marc BosmanThe Brazilian Penal Code defines an official or civil servant as follows: ""Article  - ... those who, although temporarily or without pay, hold a position, employment or public usefulness. §  - Equivalent to a public official who holds a position, job or function in parastatal entity, and who works for the company providing the service or the private contractor for the execution of activity typical of public administration.""The Burke Group is a U.S.-based international management consulting firm. Formally known as Burke International and founded in  by Steven J Burke Sr., the company has headquarters in Canberra, Australia; Casper, Wyoming, United States; Los Angeles, United States and London, United Kingdom.The Burke Group describes itself as an ""international leader"" in guiding management during union recognition campaigns. It provides commercial services to private and public employers. Services are also offered toward business development and leadership training.
Critics of The Burke Group call the firm's practices professional union busting.The CEO and President is Dallas J Weatherill. Weatherill is an Australian politician who served as the fourth chairman. He was given % of the Burke Group in .The Caribbean Community Administrative Tribunal, or CCAT, is a tribunal tasked with being the ultimate arbiter of employment disputes for all staff at the CARICOM Secretariat and other CARICOM institutions, as these bodies, being international organizations, are not subject to local laws and national courts. The establishment of the administrative tribunal was approved in February  at the Thirtieth Inter-Sessional Meeting of the CARICOM Heads of Government and its statute adopted.A pre-entry closed shop (or simply closed shop) is a form of union security agreement under which the employer agrees to hire union members only, and employees must remain members of the union at all times to remain employed. This is different from a post-entry closed shop (US: union shop), which is an agreement requiring all employees to join the union if they are not already members. In a union shop, the union must accept as a member any person hired by the employer. By comparison, an open shop does not require union membership of potential and current employees.
International Labour Organization covenants do not address the legality of closed shop provisions, leaving the question up to each individual nation. The legal status of closed shop agreements varies widely from country to country, ranging from bans on the agreement, to extensive regulation of the agreement to not mentioning it at all.In corporate governance, codetermination (also ""copartnership"" or ""worker participation"") is a practice where workers of an enterprise have the right to vote for representatives on the board of directors in a company. It also refers to staff having binding rights in work councils on issues in their workplace. The first laws requiring worker voting rights include the Oxford University Act  and the Port of London Act  in the United Kingdom, the Act on Manufacturing Companies of  in Massachusetts in the United States (although the act's provisions were completely voluntary), and the Supervisory Board Act  (Aufsichtsratgesetz ) in Germany, which codified collective agreement from .Most countries with codetermination laws have single-tier board of directors in their corporate law (such as Sweden, France or the Netherlands), while a number in central Europe (particularly Germany and Austria) have two-tier boards.
The threshold of a company's size where co-determination must apply varies between countries: in Denmark it is set at  employees, in Germany over  (for / representation) and  (for just under a half), and in France for over  employees. Sweden has had a law of codetermination since .Collective Action for Safe Spaces (CASS) is an American nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C. It says it is ""a grassroots organization that works to build a community free from public sexual harassment and assault.""The group's outlook is feminist and intersectional, focusing on how street harassment and toxic masculinity affect women as well as LGBT people and people of color. It supports the decriminalization of sex work through its DecrimNow campaign. The group and its members heavily use social media in campaigns.In May , CASS launched the Safe Bars Collective, a training program to help bar staff recognize signals that someone might feel unsafe or uncomfortable. The initiative also trains transgender workers of color in Washington, D.C. alongside the Restaurant Opportunities Center.Collective agreement coverage or union representation refers to the proportion of people in a country population whose terms and conditions at work are made by collective bargaining, between an employer and a trade union, rather than by individual contracts. This is invariably higher than the union membership rate, because collective agreements almost always protect non-members in a unionised workplace. This means that, rather than individuals who have weaker bargaining power representing themselves in negotiations, people organise to represent each other together when negotiating for better pay and conditions in their workplace. The number of people who are covered by collective agreements is higher than the number of union members (or the ""union density"" rate), and in many cases substantially higher, because when trade unions make collective agreements they aim to cover everyone at work, even those who have not necessarily joined for membership.The Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers ( December ) is a principles-based charter of human rights that apply specifically to the workforce in the European Union. It is used as an interpretative aid by the Court of Justice of the European Union in construing the meaning of legislation and developing case law. It was initially drafted in . All member states have adopted the text. (Initially, the United Kingdom under Margaret Thatcher's government did not adopt the charter, but the UK subsequently adopted the Charter in ).A company code of conduct is a document written up voluntarily by a company in which it sets out a set of principles that it commits itself to follow, or requires its employees to follow. In some cases, codes of conduct reach suppliers, subcontractors, and third parties. It is a type of code of conduct.Compulsory arbitration is arbitration of labor disputes which laws of some communities force the two sides, labor and management, to undergo. These laws mostly apply when the possibility of a strike seriously affects the public interest. Some labor contracts make specific provisions for compulsory arbitration should the two sides fail to reach agreement through the regular system of collective bargaining.A conditional dismissal is a dismissal subject to conditions—for example, the dismissal of a suit for foreclosure of a mortgage, subject to receipt of payment in the amount of a tender which induced the dismissal.  Thompson v Crains,  Ill ,  NE ,  ALR .


== References ==In employment law, constructive dismissal, also called constructive discharge or constructive termination, occurs when an employee resigns as a result of the employer creating a hostile work environment. Since the resignation was not truly voluntary, it is, in effect, a termination. For example, when an employer places extraordinary and unreasonable work demands on an employee to obtain their resignation, this can constitute a constructive dismissal.
The exact legal consequences differ between different countries, but generally a constructive dismissal leads to the employee's obligations ending and the employee acquiring the right to make claims against the employer.
The employee may resign over a single serious incident or over a pattern of incidents. Generally, a party seeking relief must have resigned soon after an unreasonable situation was imposed.Control Council Law No , Works Councils ( April ) was a German labour law drafted in Allied-occupied Germany by the Military Government, to enable organisation of work councils in rebuilding the economy and society after World War II. Work councils, which employees of a firm organised and elected democratically to determine workplace issues, had existed in Germany in various forms since . They had been abolished by Adolf Hitler's Nazi party. The new Control Council Law No  provided a template for democratic German trade unions to reorganise through collective agreements with employers.Criminal syndicalism has been defined as a doctrine of criminal acts for political, industrial, and social change.  These criminal acts include advocation of crime, sabotage, violence, and other unlawful methods of terrorism. Criminal syndicalism laws were enacted to oppose economic radicalism.Cut throat competition is a term that was widely used to describe the reason for consumer protection regulation, labour law, and enforcement of competition law or antitrust, in the late th and early th century.
In economics, cut throat competition is also referred to as ruinous, excessive or unfettered competition. More generally, cut throat competition is also subsumed under the term ""destructive competition"".
Many countries have strict legislation against cut throat competition and anti-competitive practices in pricing.According to the Federal Trade Commission, the alleged necessity of a pricing agreement to avoid cut-throat competition is not considered a valid defense in the case of a proven price fixing agreement.The Law on Salaried Employees (Danish: Funktionærloven), properly Lov om retsforholdet mellem arbejdsgivere og funktionærer (law on the legal relationship between employers and salaried employees), is a Danish law which gives salaried employees certain rights with regard to termination, vacation, illness, non-solicitation and non-competition clauses, etc.
The first version of the law was adopted in ; it was last revised in . The Act is not a general employment law, because it applies only to certain occupational groups—those defined under Danish law as salaried. The core group consists of employees engaged in clerical work, trade (for example, shop assistants), inventory processing, technical or clinical work (for example, engineers, nurses and doctors), management, etc. However, executives who are not subject to supervision, for example, CEOs, are not covered by the law.
In principle, the Act is not applicable to employees engaged in craft or factory work, agriculture, fishery, waiting tables, kitchen work, etc. However, although many sectors of employment are not immediately subject to the law, the law nonetheless applies to a portion of such sectors through employment contracts or agreements which provide that the law is to apply (for example, auxiliary nurses, educators, social and health care assistants, and Folkeskole teachers). In Denmark, these are sometimes referred to as aftalefunktionærer (contract salaried employees) as opposed to lovfunktionærer (legal salaried employees), to whom the law automatically applies. Finally, some occupational groups in principle covered by the Act, by virtue of agreements derogating from the law have a legal status which is better or worse than is provided for under the Act.
There is a requirement for the law to be applicable that the employee works at least  hours a week on average, and also a requirement that the employee is not a civil servant.
The regulations concerning termination of employment under the Act establish a system of notices of termination based on the employee's length of service, which cannot be derogated from to the detriment of the employee. There is also the possibility of compensation in certain cases.
The regulations concerning non-solicitation and non-competition clauses under the Act entitle the employee to compensation amounting to half pay during the period after leaving the job during which the employee is covered by such clauses.The Danish Holiday Act (Danish: 'Ferieloven') is a Danish law regulating holiday time for employees.The act states how many days of paid holiday most employees in Denmark are legally entitled to. The law covers employees who receive wages for work performed in compliance with an employer, not including freelancers and employees working for the state.  A new law was passed on  January  by the Danish Parliament. It consists of a new concept of concurrent holidays and includes a transition period from  September  –  August  before being implemented on  September . The concept of concurrent holidays allows employees to earn . holiday days each month, which they have access to use immediately, as opposed to the old scheme where workers earned holiday days for the following year.The Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work was adopted in , at the th International Labour Conference. It is a statement made by the International Labour Organization ""that all Members, even if they have not ratified the Conventions in question, have an obligation arising from the very fact of membership in the Organization to respect, to promote and to realize, in good faith and in accordance with the Constitution, the principles concerning the fundamental rights which are the subject of those Conventions"".Carl Degenkolb (-) was a German industrialist, who is generally understood to have pioneered the first codetermination plans in his factories, as well as participating in drafting the first codetermination law during the failed  Revolutions.In French Labour Law a Dismissal is the breach of the employment contract by the employer. French Labour Law stipulates that an employment contract can be terminated by either of the parties. The  reform of Labour Law introduced the possibility of a negotiated termination (voluntary termination of employment).A domestic worker or domestic servant is a person who works within the scope of a residence. The term ""domestic service"" applies to the equivalent occupational category. In traditional English contexts, such a person was said to be ""in service"". Domestic workers perform a variety of household services for an individual, from providing cleaning and household maintenance, or cooking, laundry and ironing, or care for children and elderly dependents, and other household errands.
Some domestic workers live within their employer's household. In some cases, the contribution and skill of servants whose work encompassed complex management tasks in large households have been highly valued. However, for the most part, domestic work tends to be demanding and is commonly considered to be undervalued, despite often being necessary. Although legislation protecting domestic workers is in place in many countries, it is often not extensively enforced. In many jurisdictions, domestic work is poorly regulated and domestic workers are subject to serious abuses, including slavery.Servant is an older English word for ""domestic worker"", though not all servants worked inside the home. Domestic service, or the employment of people for wages in their employer's residence, was sometimes simply called ""service"" and has often been part of a hierarchical system. In Britain a highly developed system of domestic service peaked towards the close of the Victorian era, perhaps reaching its most complicated and rigidly structured state during the Edwardian period (a period known in the United States as the Gilded Age and in France as the Belle Époque), which reflected the limited social mobility before World War I.A duvet day is a formal allowance of time off given by some employers, most commonly in the United Kingdom and United States. It differs from holiday allowance in that no prior notice is needed. Employees receive an allocation of days where if they do not want to go to work for any reason they can use a duvet day. The name is a reference to the item of bedding.
Duvet days were originally given to employees by UK company August One Communications in , and the idea has grown in popularity as some companies aim to address the changing work-life climate where people work longer hours. It can be stipulated formally in a contract of employment and is considered part of the remunerations package along with holiday allowance. The term has also since become used by people to reference taking a day off work for no normally accepted reason (such as mild sickness, grievance or holiday) even if they have no official duvet day entitlement with their employer.
In the Indian subcontinent, this is historically called a casual leave. Employees usually are sanctioned a fixed number of days off (usually  per year for government and - for private employees). These days can be taken with or without planning. Since these leave days could not be accumulated or carried over into the next year, they would expire at the year end. This created a tendency to utilize all the left over casual leave in November and December. The Indian casual leave has been around for more than  years.

Use of E-Verify at the state level varies; some states have mandated use of E-Verify or similar programs, while others have discouraged the program.E-Verify compares information from an employee's Employment Eligibility Verification Form I- to data from U.S. government records. If the information matches, that employee is eligible to work in the United States. If there is a mismatch, E-Verify alerts the employer and the employee is allowed to work while he or she resolves the problem; they must contact the appropriate agency to resolve the mismatch within eight federal government work days from the referral date. The program is operated by the DHS in partnership with the Social Security Administration. According to the DHS website, more than , employers used E-Verify as of .Research shows that E-Verify harms the labor market outcomes of illegal immigrants and improves the labor market outcomes of Mexican legal immigrants and U.S.-born Hispanics, but has no impact on labor market outcomes for non-Hispanic white Americans. A  study suggests that E-Verify reduces the number of illegal immigrants in states that have mandated use of E-Verify for all employers, and further notes that the program may deter illegal immigration to the United States in general.Emanation of the state is a term used in European law to describe any body which provides a public service under the control of government. The term was defined by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in , in the case of Foster, A and others v. British Gas plc. The ECJ's ruling defines the term as:

A body, whatever its legal form, which has been made responsible, pursuant to a measure adopted by the state, for providing a public service under the control of the state and has for that purpose special powers beyond that which result from the normal rules applicable in relations between individuals.
The term is most obviously used to describe public sector employers, such as the police, fire service, local government bodies or schools.The Employees' Trust Fund (ETF), a social security programme, was established on  March  under the Act No. of  by the Parliament of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka
to promote (i).employee ownership, employee welfare and economic democracy through participation in financing and investment (ii).employee participation in management through the acquisition of equity interest in enterprises and to provide for non-contributory benefits to employees upon retirement. All workers i.e. Permanent, Temporary, Casual, Contract, Piece-rate wages, Learners and apprentices  who are employed in private and public sector are eligible to be benefited by it.Employment (Equal Opportunities) Law is an Israeli law passed in , that prohibits the employer from discriminating between job applicants or employees on the following criteria:

Sex
Sexual orientation
Pregnancy
Fertility treatment
Parenting
Age
Race
Religion
Nationality
Country of origin
Residence
Political view
Reservist dutyAnything required by the character or substance of the position or job is not to be deemed discriminatory by the law. Prohibition of discrimination applies to hiring, working conditions, promotion, professional training or studies, discharge or severance pay and benefits and payments provided for employees in connection with their retirement from employment. The law was enacted in , and replaced an earlier  law.The law further provides that, under certain conditions, provisions in an enactment, collective agreement or employment contract made in connection with maternity are not to be considered discriminatory. It also provides that any rights given to working mothers are to be given equally to working fathers, under certain conditions. Protection from sexual harassment is addressed in section , which states that an employer shall not ""act against"" an employee who rejects, or opposes, any act of a sexual nature committed by the employer or by the supervisor of the employee.
Violation of the law constitutes both a civil and criminal offence, and courts may grant compensation even when no material damage was caused. In addition, civil proceedings can be initiated by an employee, an employee organization or civil rights group, with special protection granted to the worker filing the complaint. The Israeli Ministry of Economy (formerly known as the Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry) is responsible for promoting the law.An employment contract or contract of employment is a kind of contract used in labour law to attribute rights and responsibilities between parties to a bargain.
The contract is between an ""employee"" and an ""employer"". It has arisen out of the old master-servant law, used before the th century. Employment contracts relies on the concept of authority, in which the employee agrees to accept the authority of the employer and in exchange, the employer agrees to pay the employee a stated wage (Simon, ).The Employment Law Alliance (ELA) is an international law firm composed of management-side labor, employment and immigration lawyers, focused on employment law and immigration law related matters. Headquartered in San Francisco, ELA counts more than , lawyers in more than  nations, and all  U.S. states among its members.Customers and members of the Employment Law Alliance are also provided access to the organization's ""Global Employer Handbook"", which details labor and employment laws around the world. This web-based resource is updated by members of the ELA. Content from the ""Global Employer Handbook"" can now be found in Aperian Global's ""GlobeSmart"" web resource.Employment protection legislation (EPL) includes all types of employment protection measures, whether grounded primarily in legislation, court rulings, collectively bargained conditions of employment, or customary practice. The term is common among circles of economists. Employment protection refers both to regulations concerning hiring (e.g. rules favouring disadvantaged groups, conditions for using temporary or fixed-term contracts, training requirements) and firing (e.g. redundancy procedures, mandated prenotification periods and severance payments, special requirements for collective dismissals and short-time work schemes).
There exist various institutional arrangements that can provide employment protection: the private market, labour legislation, collective bargaining arrangements and not the least, court interpretations of legislative and contractual provisions. Some forms of de facto regulations are likely to be adopted even in the absence of legislation, simply because both workers and firms derive advantages from long-term employment relations.Employment testing is the practice of administering written, oral, or other tests as a means of determining the suitability or desirability of a job applicant.  The premise is that if scores on a test correlate with job performance, then it is economically useful for the employer to select employees based on scores from that test.Corporate law (also known as business law, company law or enterprise law) is the body of law governing the rights, relations, and conduct of persons, companies, organizations and businesses. The term refers to the legal practice of law relating to corporations, or to the theory of corporations. Corporate law often describes the law relating to matters which derive directly from the life-cycle of a corporation. It thus encompasses the formation, funding, governance, and death of a corporation.
While the minute nature of corporate governance as personified by share ownership, capital market, and business culture rules differ, similar legal characteristics and legal problems exist across many jurisdictions. Corporate law regulates how corporations, investors, shareholders, directors, employees, creditors, and other stakeholders such as consumers, the community, and the environment interact with one another. Whilst the term company or business law is colloquially used interchangeably with corporate law, the term business law mostly refers to wider concepts of commercial law, that is the law relating to commercial and business related purposes and activities. In some cases, this may include matters relating to corporate governance or financial law. When used as a substitute for corporate law, business law means the law relating to the business corporation (or business enterprises), including such activity as raising capital, company formation, and registration with the government.Essential services may refer to a class of occupations that have been legislated by a government to have special restrictions in regard to labour actions such as not being allowed to strike.
The International Labour Office, a United Nations agency, distinguishes an essential service from a minimum service.Industries defined as essential services differ based on the organization or government but generally include services such as hospitals and other healthcare, utilities such as electricity and water supply, law enforcement and firefighting, and food services.European Works Councils (EWC) are information and consultation bodies representing employees in European multinational companies.False self-employment is a situation in which somebody registered as self-employed, a freelancer, or a temp is de facto an employee carrying out a professional activity under the authority and subordination of another company. Such false self-employment is often a way to circumvent social welfare and employment legislation, for example by avoiding employer's social security and income tax contributions. While a modern ""gig economy"" encourages more casual employment practices in the interests of labour flexibility, the extent to which this disguises precarious employment and denial of rights is of growing concern to authorities.There is a grey area of self-employed persons who rely heavily on a single customer while legitimately being independent.Matthew W. Finkin (born  April ) is one of the leading labor law scholars in the United States. He co-authors the foundational textbook Labor Law: Cases and Materials and is co-editor of the international journal, the Comparative Labor Law & Policy Journal.Finkin graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University, then with an LL.B. from New York University, an LL.M. from Yale University. He worked at the Southern Methodist University from  to , before moving to the University of Illinois in .A fixed-term contract is a contractual relationship between an employee and an employer that lasts for a specified period. These contracts are usually regulated by countries' labor laws, to ensure that employers still fulfill basic labour rights regardless of a contract's form, particularly unjust dismissal. Generally, fixed-term contracts will automatically be deemed to have created a permanent contract, subject to the employer's right to terminate employment on reasonable notice for a good reason. In the European Union the incidence of fixed-term contracts ranges from % in the UK to % in Spain, with Germany, Italy and France between % and %.Fluctuating workweek overtime, sometimes also called Chinese overtime, is the practice of calculating overtime wages based on a salaried employee's average hourly wage.The Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal Act of , also known as The FAIR ACT, is proposed legislation in the US Congress. The comprehensive legislation would prohibit pre-dispute, forced arbitration agreements from being valid or enforceable if it requires forced arbitration of an employment, consumer, or civil rights claim against a corporation.The bill was introduced in the th Congress as H.R.  and S. . The bill's sponsors include Representative Hank Johnson (D-GA) and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). Similar versions of this bill were previously introduced in the th United States Congress as H.R.   and S. . The FAIR Act passed the House of Representatives on September , , by a vote of  to .Blumenthal re-introduced the FAIR Act in the th Congress due to the FAIR Act not passing the Senate in the th Congress. The Senate version of the bill, S., has  cosponsors, all of them being Democrats.As the number of foreign domestic workers (FDW, also known as migrant domestic workers) continues to increase around the world, social movements to protect them have begun. The increase in social movements can be attributed to the rise of globalization, increased flows of migratory workers, and issues arising from the neoliberal management of workers. Repeated complaints and demands by pro-labor movements typically revolving around issues such as minimum wage and insurance coverage can be seen. These demands usually move away from a narrative of labor disputes and begin to encompass a human-rights perspective.
How these social movements manifest depends on the level of restrictions and autonomy given workers by employers and foreign governments. Although Hong Kong allows demonstrations and NGOs, the Middle East continues to outlaw such practices. This has led some workers to alternative forms of resistance.
Protesting outside one's home country is a relatively-new phenomenon, and scholars have noted that the potential to protest relies on a quasi-stateless nature. Although foreign domestic workers receive visas to live and work temporarily in their host country, they rarely become citizens or permanent residents of their country of employment.The Freelance Isn't Free Act (FIFA) is a local New York City law passed by the New York City Council in  that protects the labor rights of freelance workers. The bill passed unanimously, after lobbying by the Freelancers Union. The law was officially enacted on May , .The law provides a legal definition for freelance work in New York City and requires companies to provide contracts for freelance workers whenever the work exceeds $. Without a contract, companies are still required to pay freelancers within  days of the work being completed. Finally, companies can't punish workers for exercising the rights granted by the law, and the law allows freelancers to charge penalty fees against companies that violate its clauses. The Act is intended to protect freelancers against clients that unreasonably withhold or delay payment for work.Frolic and detour in the law of torts occur when an employee (or agent) makes a physical departure from the service of his employer (or principal).  A detour occurs when an employee or agent makes a minor departure from his employer's charge whereas a frolic is a major departure when the employee is acting on his own and for his own benefit, rather than a minor sidetrack in the course of obeying an order from the employer. 
The employer will be relieved of vicarious liability, which is usually assessed through the doctrine of respondeat superior for torts committed by the employee only if the employee has been deemed to engage in a frolic.Similarly, in the law of workers' compensation, an employer is not liable for injuries incurred by an employee during a frolic, but the employer can still face liability for the results of a detour.
The term was coined in Joel v Morison.The Ghent system is the name given to an arrangement in some countries whereby the main responsibility for welfare payments, especially unemployment benefits, is held by trade unions rather than a government agency. The system is named after the city of Ghent, Belgium, where it was first implemented. It is the predominant form of unemployment benefit in Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Sweden. Belgium has a hybrid or ""quasi-Ghent"" system, in which the government also plays a significant role in distributing benefits. In all of the above countries, unemployment funds held by unions or labour federations are regulated and/or partly subsidised by the national government concerned.
Because workers in many cases need to belong to a union to receive benefits, union membership is higher in countries with the Ghent system. Furthermore, the state benefit is a fixed sum, but the benefits from unemployment funds depend on previous earnings.A Greenfield agreement is an agreement between a union and a new employer that does not yet have employees. [] [].
This has a number of benefits for the employer. A key advantage is that a greenfield agreement does not require the approval of any employees whose employment would be subject to the agreement. Basically, there are no employees to negotiate with. Another key benefit is that a greenfield agreement provides an employer with the opportunity to shut out less desirable unions as parties and therefore effectively having a presence at the new business before the employment of any employees.
Greenfield agreements must involve a genuinely new enterprise; a business cannot simply initiate a new project and use this as grounds to negotiate a greenfield agreement. []In Austria and Germany, hand and hitch-up services (i.e. services of manual work and with hitched-up cart or more modern vehicles, German: Hand- und Spanndienste or Hand- und Zugdienste) or more contemporary (mandatory) municipal services (German: ""Gemeindedienste"") are allowed in some Austrian and German states. In the s in rural municipalities, citizens were drafted for mandatory community service frequently, but nowadays only small municipalities draft their citizens, like the German town of Winsen an der Aller once a year or Bezau in Austria.A high heel policy is a regulation or law about the wearing of high heels, which may be required or forbidden in different places and circumstances.
Historically in the West high heels were associated with aristocrats for cosmetic reasons, to emphasize social status among an elite who could afford to wear impractical footwear, to raise their height, or to keep feet and long dresses clean.  The style was then subject to sumptuary laws.  In more modern times, stiletto heels have been restricted when they might damage the floor surface or cause accidents.
Some dress codes, however, require women to wear high heels so that they appear to be taller and more attractive.  Such footwear may be painful and damage the feet, and there have been repeated protests by women workers against such policies.  In , a British receptionist was dismissed for not wearing high heels and she then started a petition which attracted sufficient support to be considered by the UK Parliament.In United States labor law, a hostile work environment exists when one's behavior within a workplace creates an environment that is difficult or uncomfortable for another person to work in, due to illegal discrimination. Common complaints in sexual harassment lawsuits include fondling, suggestive remarks, sexually-suggestive photos displayed in the workplace, use of sexual language, or off-color jokes. Small matters, annoyances, and isolated incidents are usually not considered to be statutory violations of the discrimination laws. For a violation to impose liability, the conduct must create a work environment that would be intimidating, hostile, or offensive to a reasonable person. An employer can be held liable for failing to prevent these workplace conditions, unless it can prove that it attempted to prevent the harassment and that the employee failed to take advantage of existing harassment counter-measures or tools provided by the employer.A hostile work environment may also be created when management acts in a manner designed to make an employee quit in retaliation for some action. For example, if an employee reported safety violations at work, was injured, attempted to join a union, or reported regulatory violations by management, and management's response was to harass and pressure the employee to quit. Employers have tried to force employees to quit by imposing unwarranted discipline, reducing hours, cutting wages, or transferring the complaining employee to a distant work location.
The United States Supreme Court stated in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc. that Title VII is ""not a general civility code"". Thus, federal law does not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not extremely serious. Rather, the conduct must be so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the individual's employment. The conditions of employment are altered only if the harassment culminates in a tangible employment action or is sufficiently severe or pervasive.In law, individual capacity is a term of art referring to one's status as a natural person, distinct from any other role.For example, an officer, employee or agent of a corporation, acting ""in their individual capacity"" is acting as an individual, rather than as an agent of the corporation. Thus, their actions, in their capacity as an individual would not generally incur a liability on the part of the corporation (this concept is also known as a corporate liability), nor would they have any protection from liability for their own actions as an individual.
In general, a person may be said by a second party to be acting in their capacity as an individual, whenever the person's actions are the result of their own decisions, rather than being actions to which they are obligated in their capacity as an agent of another person or agency.


== References ==Industrial arbitration is a type of arbitration to prevent or settle labor disputes that may arise between an industrial employer and a union, union member, or union representative to prevent legal action taking place and finding less costly ways to settle disputes.
Taking an issue to court or a breakdown of negotiations can be dangerous for both management and labor, and as such parties are often willing to negotiate and plead their cases with a third party arbiter to come to fair decisions.  Industrial arbitration refers to this process taking place in which labor and management will sit down and solve a dispute.This process often benefits the employer because it reduces the chances of a strike or legal action, and benefits the employee because it allows them more bargaining power and prevents mass layoffs in a dispute.  However, at times the government has been known to step in regardless of arbitration clauses and force its own remedies.Industrial democracy is an arrangement which involves workers making decisions, sharing responsibility and authority in the workplace. While in participative management organizational designs workers are listened to and take part in the decision-making process, in organizations employing industrial democracy they also have the final decisive power (they decide about organizational design and hierarchy as well).In company law, the term generally used is co-determination, following the German word Mitbestimmung. In Germany, companies with more than  employees (or more than  employees in the coal and steel industries) have half of their supervisory boards of directors (which elect management) elected by the shareholders and half by the workers.
Although industrial democracy generally refers to the organization model in which workplaces are run directly by the people who work in them in place of private or state ownership of the means of production, there are also representative forms of industrial democracy. Representative industrial democracy includes decision-making structures such as the formation of committees and consultative bodies to facilitate communication between management, unions, and staff.The International Association of Labour Law Journals is a learned society that aims to promote the international study and exchange of labour law publications. It consists of twenty-one law reviews published in countries across the world. The current president is Steven L. Willborn (University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Law).International labour law is the body of rules spanning public and private international law which concern the rights and duties of employees, employers, trade unions and governments in regulating Work (human activity) and the workplace. The International Labour Organization and the World Trade Organization have been the main international bodies involved in reforming labour markets. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have indirectly driven changes in labour policy by demanding structural adjustment conditions for receiving loans or grants. Issues regarding Conflict of laws arise, determined by national courts, when people work in more than one country, and supra-national bodies, particularly in the law of the European Union, has a growing body of rules regarding labour rights.
International labour standards refer to conventions agreed upon by international actors, resulting from a series of value judgments, set forth to protect basic worker rights, enhance workers’ job security, and improve their terms of employment on a global scale. The intent of such standards, then, is to establish a worldwide minimum level of protection from inhumane labour practices through the adoption and implementation of said measures.  From a theoretical standpoint, it has been maintained, on ethical grounds, that there are certain basic human rights that are universal to humankind. Thus, it is the aim of international labour standards to ensure the provision of such rights in the workplace, such as against workplace aggression, bullying, discrimination and gender inequality on the other hands for working diversity, workplace democracy and empowerment.
While the existence of international labour standards does not necessarily imply implementation or enforcement mechanisms, most real world cases have utilised formal treaties and agreements stemming from international institutions. The primary international agency charged with developing working standards is the International Labour Organization (ILO). Established in , the ILO advocates international standards as essential for the eradication of labour conditions involving ""injustice, hardship and privation"". According to the ILO, international labour standards contribute to the possibility of lasting peace, help to mitigate potentially adverse effects of international market competition and help the progress of international development.
Implementation, however, is not limited to the ILO nor is it constrained to the legislative model that the ILO represents.  Other alternatives include direct trade sanctions, multilateral enforcement, and voluntary standards. In addition to controversies that arise over each of these models, greater issues have also been raised concerning the debate over the need for international labour standards themselves. However, while critics have arisen, the international community has largely come to a consensus in favour of basic protection of the world’s labour force from inhumane practices.Associated with the development of successful international labour standards is proper monitoring and enforcement of labour standards. Most monitoring occurs through the ILO, but domestic agencies and other NGOs also play a role in the successful monitoring of international labour standards.The International Society for Labour and Social Security Law is an international association whose purpose is to study labour and social security law at the national and international level, to promote the exchange of ideas and information from a comparative perspective, and to encourage collaboration among academics, lawyers, and other experts within the fields of labour and social security law.
Founded in , the ISLSSL is composed of national affiliates whose members are scholars, union and management lawyers, judges, government officials, arbitrators, industrial relations and human resources specialists, and others interested in promoting international exchange of ideas and information and in developing collaboration among experts in the fields of labor, employment and employee benefits law.
The current members of the Executive Committee are Steven L. Willborn (Chair), George Nicolau, Vice-Chair, and Alvin L. Goldman, Secretary-Treasurer.
For many of those active in issues in the workplace, the internationalization of labor law and relations is becoming a reality.  To highlight just a few areas in this field of growing attention to the global legal landscape, those in academia work on issues of comparative labor and employment law, union lawyers consider international aspects of comprehensive corporate campaigns in support of the objectives of their clients, and management attorneys are increasingly called upon to give advice on the international ramifications of the employment policies of their employer clients.Juarez v. AutoZone Stores, Inc., Case No. -CV--WVG (S.D. Cal. Nov. , ), was a court case in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California which is believed to be the largest single-plaintiff employment verdict in United States history at $,,.. This case is also believed to be the largest punitive damages verdict awarded to a single plaintiff in an employment discrimination lawsuit.A labor court (or labour court or industrial tribunal) is a governmental judiciary body which rules on labor or employment-related matters and disputes. In a number of countries, labor cases are often taken to separate national labor high courts. Other states, such as the United States, possess general non-judiciary labour relations boards which govern union certifications and elections.Labor Relations Reference Manual (LRRM) is an American case reporter devoted exclusively to labor law published by the Bureau of National Affairs (BNA). It is published  times a year and includes decisions of federal and some state courts, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), state agencies, and other material of reference value.  It is one part of the Labor Relations Reporter service (weekly/biweekly) and has been published since .

These rights are codified in national and international labor and employment law. In general, these rights influence working conditions in relations of employment. One of the most prominent is the right to freedom of association, otherwise known as the right to organize. Workers organized in trade unions exercise the right to collective bargaining to improve working conditions.A labour code, (also called a code of labour laws) is a codification of labour laws in legislative form.
One of the first labour codes was first introduced in  in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, as a legal framework underlying the requirement to ensure the right to work declared in the first Soviet Constitution.In the aftermath of post-war the labour codes basing upon the same set of social guarantees were introduced in German Democratic Republic, People's Republic of Hungary, People's Republic of Poland and the other socialist countries in Central and Eastern Europe.
Presently the Labour Code exists in Russian Federation and in some other former Soviet Republics.
In Canada the Labour Code (R.S., , c. L-) was adopted in  superseding the Industrial Relations and Disputes Investigation Act of .""Labour is not a commodity"" is the principle expressed in the preamble to the International Labour Organization's founding documents. It expresses the view that people should not be treated like inanimate commodities, capital, another mere factor of production, or resources. Instead, people who work for a living should be treated as human beings and accorded dignity and respect. Paul O'Higgins attributes the phrase to John Kells Ingram, who used it in  during a meeting in Dublin of the British Trades Union Congress.Labour standards in the World Trade Organization are binding rules, which form a part of the jurisprudence and principles applied within the rule making institutions of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Labour standards play an implicit, but not an overt role within the WTO, however it forms a prominent issue facing the WTO today, and has generated a wealth of academic debate.The debate about the extent to which the WTO should recognise labour standards is typically based on the principles found in Conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), as well as mainstream human rights treaties, most prominently, the International Bill of Human Rights.A layoff or downsizing is the temporary suspension or permanent termination of employment of an employee or, more commonly, a group of employees (collective layoff) for business reasons, such as personnel management or downsizing (reducing the size of) an organization. Originally, layoff referred exclusively to a temporary interruption in work, or employment but this has evolved to a permanent elimination of a position in both British and US English, requiring the addition of ""temporary"" to specify the original meaning of the word. A layoff is not to be confused with wrongful termination. Laid off workers or displaced workers are workers who have lost or left their jobs because their employer has closed or moved, there was insufficient work for them to do, or their position or shift was abolished (Borbely, ). Downsizing in a company is defined to involve the reduction of employees in a workforce. Downsizing in companies became a popular practice in the s and early s as it was seen as a way to deliver better shareholder value as it helps to reduce the costs of employers (downsizing, ). Research on downsizing in the US, UK, and Japan suggests that downsizing is being regarded by management as one of the preferred routes to help declining organizations, cutting unnecessary costs, and improve organizational performance. Usually a layoff occurs as a cost-cutting measure.The legal working age is the minimum age required by law for a person to work, in each country or jurisdiction, if they have not reached the age of majority. Activities that are dangerous, harmful to the health or that may affect the morals of minors fall into this category.Smithfield Foods has been sued multiple times related to the disposal of hog waste using  anaerobic lagoons. State governments have responded to the suits against Smithfield and similar litigation by strengthening ”Right-to-Farm” laws.In employment law, a Loudermill letter is a letter that public-sector employers may send to employees giving notice of their intent to suspend, demote, or terminate.
According to Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, the process that is due a public employee includes a pre-termination hearing that provides ""oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.""  The Loudermill letter fulfills the requirement of (written) notice, and should include an explanation of the employer's evidence (""to act as a check for mistaken accusations""). To fulfill the remaining Due Process requirements, a Loudermill letter will also have to inform the employee of his opportunity for a Loudermill hearing.A love contract is a legal contract that is meant to limit the liability of an employer whose employees are romantically involved. An employer may choose to require a love contract when a romantic relationship within the company becomes known, in order to indemnify the company in case the employees' romantic relationship fails, primarily so that one party can't bring a sexual harassment lawsuit against the company. To that end, the love contract states that the relationship is consensual, and both parties of the relationship must sign it. The love contract may also stipulate rules for acceptable romantic behavior in the workplace.

Not all countries provide mothers with a pay rate equal to what they would have received if the absence had not occurred.
Rate of basic pay can be defined as fixed pay received through minimum wage law or an administratively-determined wage. Organizations and activists are working to inform, persuade and change pay-rate laws. Women in the workforce are at a disadvantage; regardless of legislation, a global gender pay gap is still visible. The OECD is a primary supplier of research and data pertaining to parental-leave rights.Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI) occurs when an injured employee reaches a state where their condition cannot be improved any further or when a treatment plateau in a person’s healing process is reached. It can mean that the patient has fully recovered from the injury or that the patient’s medical condition has stabilized to the point that no major medical or emotional change can be expected in the injured workers’ condition.  At that point, no further healing or improvement is deemed possible and this occurs despite continuing medical treatment or rehabilitative programs the injured worker partakes in. When a worker who is receiving Workers' Compensation benefits reaches maximum medical improvement, his or her condition is assessed and a degree of permanent or partial impairment is determined. This degree will impact the amount of benefits the worker is able to receive.
Maximum medical improvement means that treatment options have been exhausted. Temporary disability payments are terminated and a settlement is worked out regarding the condition of the worker at this point.In workplaces, especially in Australia, a mental health day is where an employee takes sick leave, or where a student does not attend school for a day or longer, for reasons other than physical illness. Mental health days are believed to reduce absenteeism and presenteeism, which is a reduction in productivity or other negative consequences resulting from a pressure to work. Mental health days differ from absenteeism in that the purpose is to reset one's mental health rather than due to a nonspecific desire or feeling to skip work.A minimum wage is the lowest remuneration that employers can legally pay their employees—the price floor below which employees may not sell their labor. Most countries had introduced minimum wage legislation by the end of the th century. Because minimum wages increase the cost of labor, companies often try to avoid minimum wage laws by using gig workers, by moving labor to locations with lower or nonexistent minimum wages, or by automating job functions.The movement for minimum wages was first motivated as a way to stop the exploitation of workers in sweatshops, by employers who were thought to have unfair bargaining power over them. Over time, minimum wages came to be seen as a way to help lower-income families. Modern national laws enforcing compulsory union membership which prescribed minimum wages for their members were first passed in New Zealand in . Although minimum wage laws are now in effect in many jurisdictions, differences of opinion exist about the benefits and drawbacks of a minimum wage.
Supply and demand models suggest that there may be employment losses from minimum wages; however, minimum wages can increase the efficiency of the labor market in monopsony scenarios, where individual employers have a degree of wage-setting power over the market as a whole. Supporters of the minimum wage say it increases the standard of living of workers, reduces poverty, reduces inequality, and boosts morale. In contrast, opponents of the minimum wage say it increases poverty and unemployment because some low-wage workers ""will be unable to find work ... [and] will be pushed into the ranks of the unemployed"".Negligence in employment encompasses several causes of action in tort law that arise where an employer is held liable for the tortious acts of an employee because that employer was negligent in providing the employee with the ability to engage in a particular act. Four basic causes of action may arise from such a scenario: negligent hiring, negligent retention, negligent supervision and negligent training. While negligence in employment may overlap with negligent entrustment and vicarious liability, the concepts are distinct grounds of liability. The doctrine that an employer is liable for torts committed by employees within the scope of their employment is called respondeat superior.The New Hire Registry is a program established in the United States pursuant to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of ,  U.S.C. a, which required each state, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government for its own employees, to establish - or contract with a provider to operate - a system where all new hires by any employer must be reported to a state-established New Hire Registry for that state.  All employers of employees for wages have been required since  to register with their state for reporting, and to report new hires within  days of employment, except employers who file new hire reports electronically, who must file a report every  to  days. The ostensible purpose of the program is to check for ""deadbeat parents"", e.g. persons not paying required child support orders, but may also be used for abuse of other payment-related programs such as unemployment insurance.The New York Disability Benefits Law (DBL) is article  of the Workers' Compensation Law (which is itself chapter  of the Consolidated Laws of New York) and creates a state disability insurance program designed to provide employees with some level of income replacement in case of disability caused off-the-job.In contract law, a non-compete clause (often NCC), restrictive covenant, or covenant not to compete (CNC), is a clause under which one party (usually an employee) agrees not to enter into or start a similar profession or trade in competition against another party (usually the employer). Some courts refer to these as ""restrictive covenants"". As a contract provision, a CNC is bound by traditional contract requirements including the consideration doctrine.
The use of such clauses is premised on the possibility that upon their termination or resignation, an employee might begin working for a competitor or start a business, and gain competitive advantage by exploiting confidential information about their former employer's operations or trade secrets, or sensitive information such as customer/client lists, business practices, upcoming products, and marketing plans.
However, an over-broad CNC may prevent an employee from working elsewhere at all. English common law originally held any such constraint to be unenforceable under the public policy doctrine. Contemporary case law permits exceptions, but generally will only enforce CNCs to the extent necessary to protect the employer. Most jurisdictions in which such contracts have been examined by the courts have deemed CNCs to be legally binding so long as the clause contains reasonable limitations as to the geographical area and time period in which an employee of a company may not compete.The extent to which non-compete clauses are legally allowed varies per jurisdiction. For example, the state of California in the United States invalidates non-compete-clauses for all but equity stakeholders in the sale of business interests.A non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is a legal contract or part of a contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to. Doctor–patient confidentiality (physician–patient privilege), attorney–client privilege, priest–penitent privilege and bank–client confidentiality agreements are examples of NDAs, which are often not enshrined in a written contract between the parties.
It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose any information covered by the agreement. An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties, typically to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or trade secrets. As such, an NDA protects non-public business information. Like all contracts, they cannot be enforced if the contracted activities are illegal. NDAs are commonly signed when two companies, individuals, or other entities (such as partnerships, societies, etc.) are considering doing business and need to understand the processes used in each other's business for the purpose of evaluating the potential business relationship. NDAs can be ""mutual"", meaning both parties are restricted in their use of the materials provided, or they can restrict the use of material by a single party. An employee can be required to sign an NDA or NDA-like agreement with an employer, protecting trade secrets. In fact, some employment agreements include a clause restricting employees' use and dissemination of company-owned confidential information. In legal disputes resolved by settlement, the parties often sign a confidentiality agreement relating to the terms of the settlement. Examples of this agreement are The Dolby Trademark Agreement with Dolby Laboratories, the Windows Insider Agreement, and the Halo CFP (Community Feedback Program) with Microsoft.
In some cases, employees who are dismissed following their complaints about unacceptable practices (whistleblowers), or discrimination against and harassment of themselves, may be paid compensation subject to an NDA forbidding them from disclosing the events complained about. Such conditions in an NDA may not be enforceable in law, although they may intimidate the former employee into silence.An occupational disease is any chronic ailment that occurs as a result of work or occupational activity. It is an aspect of occupational safety and health. An occupational disease is typically identified when it is shown that it is more prevalent in a given body of workers than in the general population, or in other worker populations. The first such disease to be recognised, squamous-cell carcinoma of the scrotum, was identified in chimney sweep boys by Sir Percival Pott in . Occupational hazards that are of a traumatic nature (such as falls by roofers) are not considered to be occupational diseases.
Under the law of workers' compensation in many jurisdictions, there is a presumption that specific disease are caused by the worker being in the work environment and the burden is on the employer or insurer to show that the disease came about from another cause. Diseases compensated by national workers compensation authorities are often termed occupational diseases. However, many countries do not offer compensations for certain diseases like musculoskeletal disorders caused by work (e.g. in Norway). Therefore, the term work-related diseases is utilized to describe diseases of occupational origin. This term however would then include both compensable and non-compensable diseases that have occupational origins.
In a landmark study published by the World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization in , , fatalities from ischemic heart disease and stroke events in  were attributed to exposure to long working hours. With these UN estimates, the global burden of work-related cardiovascular diseases has been quantified for the first time.An occupational exposure limit is an upper limit on the acceptable concentration of a hazardous substance in workplace air for a particular material or class of materials. It is typically set by competent national authorities and enforced by legislation to protect occupational safety and health. It is an important tool in risk assessment and in the management of activities involving handling of dangerous substances. There are many dangerous substances for which there are no formal occupational exposure limits. In these cases, hazard banding or control banding strategies can be used to ensure safe handling.Historically there have been differences among investigators regarding the definition of organizational culture. Edgar Schein, a leading researcher in this field, defined ""organizational culture"" as comprising a number of features, including a shared ""pattern of basic assumptions"" which group members have acquired over time as they learn to successfully cope with internal and external organizationally relevant problems. Elliott Jaques first introduced the concept of culture in the organizational context in his  book The Changing Culture of a Factory. The book was a published report of ""a case study of developments in the social life of one industrial community between April,  and November "". The ""case"" involved a publicly-held British company engaged principally in the manufacture, sale, and servicing of metal bearings. The study concerned itself with the description, analysis, and development of corporate group behaviours.Ravasi and Schultz () characterise organizational culture as a set of shared assumptions that guide behaviors. It is also the pattern of such collective behaviors and assumptions that are taught to new organizational members as a way of perceiving and, even thinking and feeling. Thus organizational culture affects the way people and groups interact with each other, with clients, and with stakeholders. In addition, organizational culture may affect how much employees identify with an organization.Schein (), Deal and Kennedy (), and Kotter () advanced the idea that organizations often have very differing cultures as well as subcultures. Although a company may have its ""own unique culture"", in larger organizations there are sometimes co-existing or conflicting subcultures because each subculture is linked to a different management team. Flamholtz and Randle () suggest that one can view organizational culture as ""corporate personality"".
They define it as it consisting of the values, beliefs, and norms which influence the behavior of people as members of an organization.The organizational culture influences the way people interact, the context within which knowledge is created, the resistance they will have towards certain changes, and ultimately the way they share (or the way they do not share) knowledge. According to Ravasi and Schultz () and Allaire and Firsirotu (), organizational culture represents the collective values, beliefs and principles of organizational members. It may also be influenced by factors such as history, type of product, market, technology, strategy, type of employees, management style, and national culture. Culture includes the organization's vision, values, norms, systems, symbols, language, assumptions, environment, location, beliefs and habits.Overtime is the amount of time someone works beyond normal working hours. The term is also used for the pay received for this time. Normal hours may be determined in several ways:

by custom (what is considered healthy or reasonable by society),
by practices of a given trade or profession,
by legislation,
by agreement between employers and workers or their representatives.Most national countries have overtime labour laws designed to dissuade or prevent employers from forcing their employees to work excessively long hours (such as the situation in the textile mills in the s). These laws may take into account other considerations than humanitarian concerns, such as preserving the health of workers so that they may continue to be productive, or increasing the overall level of employment in the economy.  One common approach to regulating overtime is to require employers to pay workers at a higher hourly rate for overtime work. Companies may choose to pay workers higher overtime pay even if not obliged to do so by law, particularly if they believe that they face a backward bending supply curve of labour.
Overtime pay rates can cause workers to work longer hours than they would at a flat hourly rate.  Overtime laws, attitudes toward overtime and hours of work vary greatly from country to country and between various sectors.On  March , shipping company P&O Ferries dismissed  members of its shipping staff, primarily from the Port of Dover, but also from Kingston upon Hull, Liverpool and Cairnryan. The decision was met with much criticism from both sides of the political divide, particularly as a result of the speed and immediacy of the crews' termination notices, which in some cases consisted of a video call or text message, terminating their employment ""with immediate effect"". Also of concern was the fact that the crews were intended to be replaced with cheaper agency labour. The two main trades unions involved—the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and Nautilus International—called for a boycott of the company and organised protests around the ports, but also outside parliament. P&O explained that for some time their business model had been impractical, resulting in losses of £ million per annum, and that they needed to drastically reduce the wage bill to become profitable. Conversely, critics argued that the parent company, DP World, had paid out large dividends the previous year of £ million, and had also made claims under the UK government's furlough scheme during the COVID- pandemic.
The British government criticised the company's actions and stated that it was looking at the legal ramifications, including whether P&O could be fined, and how other contracts it held with DP World were affected. The legal community was generally critical of P&O for seemingly ignoring UK employment law, and several law firms commented on the likelihood of any crew members' potential employment tribunal claim being successful on a number of grounds. For its part, P&O argued that to have followed the suggested consultation and other processes would have caused even more trauma to both their own staff and the broader UK tourist industry.The labour law concept of leave, specifically paid leave or, in some countries' long-form, a leave of absence, is an authorised prolonged absence from work, for any reason authorised by the workplace. When people ""take leave"" in this way, they are usually taking days off from their work that have been pre-approved by their employer in their contracts of employment. Labour laws normally mandate that these paid-leave days be compensated at either % of normal pay, or at a very high percentage of normal days' pay, such as % or %. A furlough is a type of leave.
There are many subcategories of paid leave, usually dependent on the reasons why the leave is being taken. Sick leave is normally compensated at % of pay, while other types of leave are often more restrictive, such as only compensating a certain percentage of normal pay, or as regards paid holidays, which in some countries are granted automatically by national governments, such as in most European Union countries, and in others, such as the United States, are a matter of employment contracts or labor union agreements, as well as state or local law.The internationally acknowledged definition of paid leave, in international labour law as observed by the International Labour Organisation and others, is one that restricts itself only to pre-approved labour agreements in the workplace.Pay-to-fly is an aviation industry practice whereby professional pilots assume duty while paying for it. The practice extends to airline training in the form of type ratings with or without employment guarantee, that some pilots pay to increase their marketability. Even though studied, the subject matter is prevented under no regulation.In Europe, positive action 
are measures which are targeted at protected groups in order to enable or encourage members of those groups to overcome or minimise disadvantage; or to meet the different needs of the
protected group; or to enable or encourage persons in protected groups to participate in an activity. In the United Kingdom in the Equality Act  ss -, the term is used in the context of employment to allow selection of a candidate from an ""under-represented"" group, so long as he or she is no less than equally qualified compared to another potential candidate that is not from the under-represented group.Power harassment is a form of harassment and workplace bullying in which someone in a position of greater power uses that power to harass or bully a lower-ranking person. It includes a range of behavior from mild irritation and annoyances to serious abuses which can even involve forced activity beyond the boundaries of the job description. Prohibited in some countries, power harassment is considered a form of illegal discrimination and political and psychological abuse. Types of power harassment include physical or psychological attacks, segregation, excessive or demeaning work assignments, and intrusion upon the victim's personal life.Power harassment may combine with other forms of bias and harassment, including sexual harassment. In the context of sexual harassment, power harassment is distinguished from contra power harassment, in which the harasser is of lower rank than that of the victim, and peer harassment, in which the victim and harasser are of the same rank. The term ""political power harassment"" was coined by Ramona Rush in a  paper on sexual harassment in academia. Because it operates to reinforce and justify an existing hierarchy, political power harassment can be difficult to assess.Principles of Labor Legislation () was a foundational US labor law text, written in the United States by John R. Commons and John Bertram Andrews.Protected Concerted Activity is a legal term used in labor policy to define employee protection against employer retaliation in the United States.  It is a legal principle under the subject of the freedom of association.  The term defines the activities workers may partake in without fear of employer retaliation. In countries where there is relatively robust employee dismissal protection, the protection of protected concerted activity is less of a distinct legal issue. In liberal market societies like the United States, where it is comparatively easy for an employer to fire an employee, the issue of protected concerted activity has become an important employment protection.  
The National Labor Relations Act, the main labor policy governing labor relations in the United States, defines concerted activity in Section .  

Section  - Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection...

Generally speaking, there is protected concerted activity when two or more employees act together to improve their terms and conditions of employment, although it is (on rare occasions) possible for conduct to be so egregious that it becomes unprotected. Employees have a right to advocate in this manner even where there is no union involved.At times, protected concerted activity has extended to individual employees; for example, when an employee speaks individually to his or her employer on behalf of him or herself and one or more co-workers about improving workplace conditions. An individual employee who seeks to enforce a collective bargaining agreement will generally be deemed to be engaged in concerted activity. On the other hand, an employee who acts as a ""whistleblower"" may or may not be engaging in concerted activity; if the complaint is entirely individual and the employee has not discussed it with co-workers, it is unlikely to be protected by the National Labor Relations Act (though it may well be protected under some other public policy).The Act does not limit the manner, time, or place in which employees can engage in concerted activity. Consequently, in recent years, the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board has often taken the position that employee conversations about common workplace issues which make use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter are protected against retaliation.


== References ==A reassignment center (also known as a rubber room) is a type of holding facility administered by the New York City Department of Education for teachers accused of misconduct while awaiting resolution of their misconduct cases. As of , the city had thirteen reassignment centers. The teachers are not required to do anything, and they may be assigned to the center for months or years.The  documentary film The Rubber Room claimed that the city's teacher union, the United Federation of Teachers, neglects to provide proper representation to teachers assigned to reassignment centers. Exonerated teachers often become absent teacher reserve teachers.The Reward Work Act of  (S. and HR ) is a proposed United States Act of Congress to ban unjustified stock buy-backs, and to require that every listed company enable employees to elect one-third of the board of directors. The Bill was sponsored initially by Senators Tammy Baldwin, Elizabeth Warren and Brian Schatz in March , joined in April  by Kirsten Gillibrand, and in November  by Bernie Sanders. It was sponsored in the House of Representatives in June  by Keith Ellison and Ro Khanna.The right to disconnect is a proposed human right regarding the ability of people to disconnect from work and primarily not to engage in work-related electronic communications such as e-mails or messages during non-work hours. The modern working environment has been drastically changed by new communication and information technologies. The boundary between work life and home life has shrunk with the introduction of digital tools into employment. While digital tools bring flexibility and freedom to employees they also can create an absence of limits, leading to excessive interference in the private lives of employees. Several countries, primarily in Europe, have some form of the right to disconnect included in their law, while in some cases it is present in the policy of many large companies. On July , , the Petition  called for introduction of the right to disconnect or as it is called in French “Le droit à la déconnexion” in the Labour Law in Luxembourg.The school leaving age is the minimum age a person is legally allowed to cease attendance at an institute of compulsory secondary education. Most countries have their school leaving age set the same as their minimum full-time employment age, thus allowing smooth transition from education into employment, whilst a few have it set just below the age at which a person is allowed to be employed.
In contrast, there are numerous countries that have several years between their school leaving age and their legal minimum employment age, thus in some cases preventing any such transition for several years. Countries which have their employment age set below the school leaving age (mostly developing countries) risk giving children the opportunity to leave their education early to earn money for their families.Sectoral collective bargaining is an aim of trade unions or labor unions to reach a collective agreement that covers all workers in a sector of the economy. It contrasts to enterprise bargaining where agreements cover individual firms. Generally countries with sectoral collective bargaining have higher rates of union organisation and better coverage of collective agreements than countries with enterprise bargaining.Sexual harassment is a type of harassment involving the use of explicit or implicit sexual overtones, including the unwelcome and inappropriate promises of rewards in exchange for sexual favors. Sexual harassment includes a range of actions from verbal transgressions to sexual abuse or assault. Harassment can occur in many different social settings such as the workplace, the home, school, or religious institutions. Harassers or victims may be of any sex or gender.In modern legal contexts, sexual harassment is illegal. Laws surrounding sexual harassment generally do not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or minor isolated incidents—that is due to the fact that they do not impose a ""general civility code."" In the workplace, harassment may be considered illegal when it is frequent or severe thereby creating a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim's demotion, firing or quitting). The legal and social understanding of sexual harassment, however, varies by culture.
Sexual harassment by an employer is a form of illegal employment discrimination. For many businesses or organizations, preventing sexual harassment and defending employees from sexual harassment charges have become key goals of legal decision-making.In Malaysia, sexual harassment, as defined by the Employment Act , is “any unwanted conduct of a sexual nature, whether verbal, non-verbal, visual, gestural or physical, directed at a person which is offensive, humiliating or a threat to their well-being”. The Act does not distinguish between male and female or employer and employee. As such, sexual harassment can be committed by a female against a male, or an employee against an employer.
The earliest recorded cases of sexual harassment at the workplace or misconduct of an employer towards an employee were seen as far back as , at the time when Malaysia was still Malaya under the British colonial rule. In , the Klang Indian Union organised a series of strike action and as part of their demands, condemned the molestation of female workers by Europeans and ‘Black Europeans’ and demanded an end to such behaviour. In ,  women and men rubber tappers from Panavan Karupiah Estate in Perak went on strike against sexual molestation.Sexual harassment in the workplace in US labor law has been considered a form of discrimination on the basis of sex in the United States since the mid-s. There are two forms of sexual harassment recognized by United States law: quid pro quo sexual harassment (requiring an employee to tolerate sexual harassment to keep their job, receive a tangible benefit, or avoid punishment) and behavior that creates a hostile work environment (persistent sexual behavior that unreasonably interferes with an employee's ability to work). It has been noted that a number of the early sexual harassment cases were brought by African American women and girls.Sick leave (or paid sick days or sick pay) is paid time off from work that workers can use to stay home to address their health needs without losing pay. It differs from paid vacation time or time off work to deal with personal matters, because sick leave is intended for health-related purposes. Sick leave can include a mental health day and taking time away from work to go to a scheduled doctor's appointment. Some policies also allow paid sick time to be used to care for sick family members, or to address health and safety needs related to domestic violence or sexual assault. Menstrual leave is another type of time off work for a health-related reason, but it is not always paid.
In most nations, some or all employers are required to pay their employees for some time away from work when they are ill. Most European, many Latin American, a few African and a few Asian countries have legal requirements for paid sick leave for employees. In nations without laws mandating paid sick leave, some employers offer it voluntarily or as the result of a collective bargaining agreement. However, in countries with poorer labor laws such as South Korea, employees are usually forced to use paid vacation time for sick leaves, and the sick leaves exceeding the remaining vacation time are unpaid.
Even where sick leave is normally required for all employees, the business owner may not be considered an employee or have access to paid sick leave, especially in a microbusiness that is operated by the owners.
Paid sick leave can reduce employee turnover, increase productivity, and reduce the spread of disease in the workplace and in the community. Naturally, paying workers when they are not working due to illness costs money that could be used for other purposes, such as higher profits or other benefits.Stringfellow Restaurants Ltd v Quashie [] EWCA Civ  is a UK labour law case concerning employment status.A sweetheart deal or sweetheart contract is a contractual agreement, usually worked out in secret, that greatly benefits some of the parties while inappropriately disadvantaging other parties or the public at large. The term was coined in the s to describe corrupt labor contracts that were favorable to the employer rather than the workers, and usually involved some kind of kickback or special treatment for the labor negotiator.The term is also applied to special arrangements between private corporations and government entities, whereby the corporation and sometimes a government official reap the benefits, rather than the public. No-bid contracts may be awarded to people who have political connections or make donations to influential politicians. Sometimes a sweetheart deal involves tax breaks or other inducements to get a corporation to do business in that city or state.A ""sweetheart settlement"" may also occur in a legal context. For example, in a class-action lawsuit the attorneys representing a class of plaintiffs may reach an agreement with the defendant in which the primary result is a lucrative fee for the attorneys rather than maximum compensation for the class members.Hans Jürgen Teuteberg ( December – February ) was a German historian, who worked as a professor of social and economic history at the University of Münster from  to .Teuteberg's magnum opus was his History of Industrial Codetermination in Germany () or Geschichte der Industriellen Mitbestimmung in Deutschland. This exhaustively examined the legal origins of codetermination laws, which are found in a majority of EU countries today, that give workers a right to participate in the management of their companies or organisations. Teuteberg traces the roots of codetermination back to Carl Degenkolb's proposals at the Frankfurt Parliament during the  Revolutions.Michele Tiraboschi (born  June  in Seriate – Italy) is a Full Professor of Labour Law at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy, and is the author of many publications. He is known for his participation in national debates on Italian labour market reforms and for his research in labour law.The toothpaste tube theory is a jocular metaphor stating that increasing pressure eventually forces some sort of release, just as when one squeezes a toothpaste tube, toothpaste comes out. It is used to explain social and political behavior, as well as relationships involving abstract concepts.TWA, Inc. v. Hardison is a landmark decision on religious liberty and employment law made in  by the US Supreme Court, holding that an employer may discharge an employee who observes a seventh-day sabbath, and that such employee is not entitled to equal employment opportunity protection under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of , which makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an employee on the basis of his religion.The Transfers of Undertakings Directive //EC is a European Union law that protects the contracts of employment of people working in businesses that are transferred between owners. It replaced and updated the law previously known as the Acquired Rights Directive //EC.Uber Technologies Inc v Heller,  SCC , is a  decision of the Supreme Court of Canada. The Court held – that an arbitration clause in a contract the plaintiff David Heller had signed with Uber was unconscionable, and hence unenforceable. As a result, it held that Heller's proposed class action lawsuit against Uber could go forward.An undue hardship is an American legal term referring to special or specified circumstances that partially or fully exempt a person or organization from performance of a legal obligation so as to avoid an unreasonable or disproportionate burden or obstacle.For example, employers are required to provide a reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities, but when an accommodation becomes too taxing on the organization it is classified as an undue hardship and is no longer required.  
These hardships include the nature and cost of the accommodation in relation to the size, resources, nature, and structure of the employer's operation.Unemployment benefits, also called unemployment insurance, unemployment payment, unemployment compensation, or simply unemployment, are payments made by authorized bodies to unemployed people. In the United States, benefits are funded by a compulsory governmental insurance system, not taxes on individual citizens. Depending on the jurisdiction and the status of the person, those sums may be small, covering only basic needs, or may compensate the lost time proportionally to the previous earned salary.
Unemployment benefits are generally given only to those registering as becoming unemployed through no fault of their own, and often on conditions ensuring that they seek work.
In British English unemployment benefits are also colloquially referred to as ""the dole""; receiving benefits is informally called ""being on the dole"". ""Dole"" here is an archaic expression meaning ""one's allotted portion"", from the synonymous Old English word dāl.An unemployment extension occurs when regular unemployment benefits are exhausted and extended for additional weeks. Unemployment extensions are created by passing new legislation at the federal level, often referred to as an ""unemployment extension bill"". This new legislation is introduced and passed during times of high or above average unemployment rates. Unemployment extensions are set during a date range in order to estimate their federal cost. After expiration, the unemployment data is re-evaluated, and new legislation may be proposed and passed to further extend them.Unemployment insurance (雇用保険, koyou hoken), also known as 失業保険 (shitsugyou hoken), is the ""user pays"" system of unemployment benefits that operates in Japan. It is paired with Workers' Accident Compensation Insurance (労働者災害補償保険, rousai hoken) and referred to collectively as Labour insurance (労働保険, roudou hoken). It is managed by Hello Work.Unemployment insurance in the United States, colloquially referred to as unemployment benefits, refers to social insurance programs which replace a portion of wages for individuals during unemployment. The first unemployment insurance program in the U.S. was created in Wisconsin in , and the federal Social Security Act of  created programs nationwide that are administered by state governments. The constitutionality of the program was upheld by the Supreme Court in .
Each of the  U.S. states, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands, administer their own unemployment insurance programs. Benefits are generally paid by state governments, funded in large part by state and federal payroll taxes levied on employers, to workers who have become unemployed through no fault of their own. Employees in Alaska, New Jersey and Pennsylvania are also required to contribute into the program. Benefit amounts for eligible workers vary by state, ranging from $ in Massachusetts to $ in Mississippi as of . According to the Internal Revenue Code, these benefits are classified as ""social welfare benefits"" and as such are included in a taxpayer's gross income. The standard duration of available unemployment compensation is six months, although extensions are possible during economic downturns. During the Great Recession, unemployment benefits were extended by  weeks.Eligibility requirements for unemployment insurance vary by state, but generally speaking, employees not fired for misconduct (""terminated for cause"") are eligible for unemployment benefits, while those fired for misconduct (this sometimes can include misconduct committed outside the workplace, such as a problematic social media post or committing a crime) are not. In every state, employees who quit their job without ""good cause"" are not eligible for unemployment benefits, but the definition of good cause varies by state. In some states, being fired for misconduct permanently bars the employee from receiving unemployment benefits, while in others it only disqualifies the employee for a short period.In labour law, unfair dismissal is an act of employment termination made without good reason or contrary to the country's specific legislation.Uninsured employer in the United States is a term to identify an employer of workers under circumstances where there is no form of insurance in place to provide certain benefits to those workers.  More specifically, it is a term used in workers’ compensation law to identify an employer who does not have some form of worker's compensation insurance or self-insurance coverage in effect at the time of, or during the time of, a claimed injury.
All States require that employers provide injury benefits coverage to their employees. These benefits are called workers’ compensation insurance coverage.  This kind of coverage is to be distinguished from liability coverage, which covers the premises and the owner/occupier of the space from claims made by non-employees for injuries on the premises. It is also to be distinguished from health insurance, which covers only medical bills for non-work incurred conditions.
Protection can be accomplished through a traditional insurance policy for workers’ compensation coverage. Coverage can also be accomplished by way of compliance with various State self-insurance laws (usually reserved for larger employers) requiring substantial bonding and self-funding.  For example, public agencies are usually permissibly self-insured.
When the employer has no specific insurance, or arrangement for the provision of workers’ compensation benefits to injured employees, the employer is then referred to as an uninsured employer.Union democracy is a term referring to the governance of trade unions, in terms of the quality of election procedures at ensuring the executives of a union most accurately represent the interests of the members.The union density or union membership rate  conveys the number of trade union members who are employees as a percentage of the total number of employees in a given industry or country. This is normally lower than collective agreement coverage rate, which refers to all people whose terms of work are collectively negotiated. Trade unions bargain with employers to improve pay, conditions, and decision-making in workplaces; higher rates of union density within an industry or country will generally indicate higher levels of trade union bargaining power, lower rates of density will indicate less bargaining power.Unpaid labor or unpaid work is defined as labor or work that does not receive any direct remuneration. This is a form of non-market work which can fall into one of two categories: () unpaid work that is placed within the production boundary of the System of National Accounts (SNA), such as gross domestic product (GDP); and () unpaid work that falls outside of the production boundary (non-SNA work), such as domestic labor that occurs inside households for their consumption. Unpaid labor is visible in many forms and isn't limited to activities within a household. Other types of unpaid labor activities include volunteering as a form of charity work and interning as a form of unpaid employment. In a lot of countries, unpaid domestic work in the household is typically performed by women, due to gender inequality and gender norms, which can result in high-stress levels in Women attempting to balance unpaid work and paid employment. In poorer countries, this work is sometimes performed by children.Unreported employment, also known as money under the table, working under the table, off the books, cash-in-hand, or illicit work is illegal employment that is not reported to the government. The employer or the employee often does so for tax evasion or avoiding and violating other laws such as obtaining unemployment benefits while being employed. The working contract is made without social security costs, and does typically not provide health insurance, paid parental leave, paid vacation or pension funds. It is a part of what has been called the underground economy, shadow economy, black market or the non-observed economy.
Payments are generally in cash, and the employer often does not check the employee's background or credentials, as is sometimes required by law or otherwise expected by the industry's client base, such as a license or professional certification.
While the hiring of the employee may or may not be legal in itself, it is often done when the employer or the employee intentionally fails to obey one or more laws.
In developed nations, unreported employment evades withholding tax and is part of the informal sector. It is hidden from the state for tax, social security, or labor law purposes but is legal in all other aspects.In law, vesting is the point in time when the rights and interests arising from legal ownership of a property is acquired by some person. Vesting creates an immediately secured right of present or future deployment.  One has a vested right to an asset that cannot be taken away by any third party, even though one may not yet possess the asset. When the right, interest, or title to the present or future possession of a legal estate can be transferred to any other party, it is termed a vested interest.
The concept can arise in any number of contexts, but the most common are inheritance law and retirement plan law. In real estate, to vest is to create an entitlement to a privilege or a right. For example, one may cross someone else's property regularly and unrestrictedly for several years, and one's right to an easement becomes vested. The original owner still retains the possession, but can no longer prevent the other party from crossing.The Webster ruling is a test case in association football law involving Andy Webster, a defender formerly with Heart of Midlothian football club in Edinburgh, Scotland. In September  he became the first player to exploit the updated transfer regulations of FIFA, football's governing body, which stipulated that players are able to unilaterally walk away from a contract after a fixed period, regardless of the duration of the contract itself. Although the long-term effects of the decision remain unclear, it has been compared to the landmark Bosman ruling of  in its potential significance.A whistleblower (also written as whistle-blower or whistle blower) is a person, often an employee, who reveals information about activity within a private or public organization that is deemed illegal, immoral, illicit, unsafe or fraudulent. Whistleblowers can use a variety of internal or external channels to communicate  information or allegations. Over % of whistleblowers report internally to a supervisor, human resources, compliance, or a neutral third party within the company, hoping that the company will address and correct the issues.  A whistleblower can also bring allegations to light by communicating with external entities, such as the media, government, or law enforcement. Whistleblowing can occur in either the private sector or the public sector.
Retaliation is a real risk for whistleblowers, who often pay a heavy price for blowing the whistle. The most common form of retaliation is  abrupt termination of employment. However, several other actions may also be considered retaliatory, including extreme increases in workloads, having hours cut drastically, preventing task completion, or bullying. Laws in many countries attempt to protect whistleblowers and to regulate the whistleblowing activities. These laws tend to adopt different approaches to public and private sector whistleblowing.
Whistleblowers do not always achieve their aims. For their claims to be credible and successful, they must have compelling evidence to support their claims that the government or regulating body can use or investigate to ""prove"" such claims and hold corrupt companies and/or government agencies to account.A work permit or work visa is the permission to take a job within a foreign country.Worker representation on corporate boards of directors, also known as board-level employee representation (BLER) refers to the right of workers to vote for representatives on a board of directors in corporate law. In , a majority of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and a majority of countries in the European Union, had some form of law guaranteeing the right of workers to vote for board representation. Together with a right to elect work councils, this is often called ""codetermination"".Workers' compensation or workers' comp is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the employee's right to sue his or her employer for the tort of negligence. The trade-off between assured, limited coverage and lack of recourse outside the worker compensation system is known as ""the compensation bargain.” One of the problems that the compensation bargain solved is the problem of employers becoming insolvent as a result of high damage awards. The system of collective liability was created to prevent that and thus to ensure security of compensation to the workers.
While plans differ among jurisdictions, provision can be made for weekly payments in place of wages (functioning in this case as a form of disability insurance), compensation for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of medical and like expenses (functioning in this case as a form of health insurance), and benefits payable to the dependents of workers killed during employment.
General damage for pain and suffering and punitive damages for employer negligence are generally not available in workers' compensation plans, and negligence is generally not an issue in the case.Workplace Fairness is a (c)() public education and advocacy organization, founded in  as the National Employee Rights Institute. According to its mission statement, the organization ""believes that fair treatment of workers is sound public policy and good business practice, and that free access to comprehensive, unbiased information about workers' rights"" is essential.

""Today's Workplace"", the Workplace Fairness blog, features daily updates on employee rights and fairness issues. According to the blog, Forbes magazine listed it as one of the ""Best of the Web"" in .Workplace Fairness publishes books on the rights of federal employees in the United States and the Employee Rights and Employment Policy Journal.A works council is a shop-floor organization representing workers that functions as a local/firm-level complement to trade unions but is independent of these at least in some countries. Works councils exist with different names in a variety of related forms in a number of European countries, including Britain (joint consultative committee or employees’ council); Germany and Austria (Betriebsrat); Luxembourg (comité mixte, délégation du personnel); the Netherlands (Dienstcommissie, Ondernemingsraad) and Flanders in Belgium (ondernemingsraad); Italy (comitato aziendale);  France (comité social et économique); Wallonia in Belgium (conseil d'entreprise), Spain (comité de empresa) and Denmark (Samarbejdsudvalg or SU).
One of the most commonly examined (and arguably most successful) implementations of this institution is found in Germany.  The model is basically as follows:  general labour agreements are made at the national level by national unions (e.g. IG Metall) and German Employer Associations (e.g. Gesamtmetall), and local plants and firms then meet with works councils to adjust these national agreements to local circumstances. Works council members are elected by the company workforce for a four-year term. They don't have to be union members; works councils can also be formed in companies where neither the employer nor the employees are organized.
Works council representatives may also be appointed to the board of directors.
As with co-determination, there are three main views about why works councils primarily exist: to reduce workplace conflict by improving and systematising communication channels; to increase bargaining power of workers at the expense of owners by means of legislation; and to correct market failures by means of public policy.In law, wrongful dismissal, also called wrongful termination or wrongful discharge, is a situation in which an employee's contract of employment has been terminated by the employer, where the termination breaches one or more terms of the contract of employment, or a statute provision or rule in employment law. Laws governing wrongful dismissal vary according to the terms of the employment contract, as well as under the laws and public policies of the jurisdiction.
A related concept is constructive dismissal in which an employee feels no choice but to resign from employment for reasons that result from the employer's violation of the employee's legal rights.In United Kingdom law, the concept of wrongful dismissal refers exclusively to dismissal contrary to the contract of employment, which effectively means premature termination, either due to insufficient notice or lack of grounds. Although wrongful dismissal is usually associated with lack of notice sometimes it can also be caused by arbitrary dismissal where no notice was required but certain grounds were specified in the contract as being the only ones available but none existed."
